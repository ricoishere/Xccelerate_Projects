0,"No Kum Sok was a North Korean fighter pilot during the Korean War. Not only that, but he was the youngest North Korean fighter pilot of the Korean War. His day job therefore consisted of flying these:
This is a MiG (Mikoyan-Gurevich)-15. It was developed using research on swept wings taken from the Germans, and powered by a reverse engineered British Rolls-Royce Nene engine which the British Minister of Trade, Sir Stafford Cripps, had for some inexplicable reason sold to the Soviets under the agreement that they would not put it in a jet fighter.
When the Korean War broke out with North Korea’s surprise attack on South Korea, the North Korean air force consisted of World War Two vintage propellor driven fighter aircraft, which were both outnumbered and outclassed by the American straight winged jets (Such as the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star) facing them. The result was American air superiority, and free rein for American B-29s to bomb North Korea.
Then suddenly, the MiG-15 appeared in the skies over Korea, and proceeded to utterly outclass the American fighters in turn. This handed control of the air back to the North, and suddenly the B-29s were not having such an easy time of it. Indeed, the Americans were so desperate to get their mitts on one that they offered a reward of $100,000 and political asylum to any pilot who would defect with one. Meanwhile they rushed their own swept wing jet fighter, the F-86 Sabre, to Korea to counter it.
Meanwhile, No was progressing through pilot training, first in the Navy and then in a Manchurian flight training programme, but he had a secret that would have landed him in deep trouble had it been revealed; He was not a communist at all. In fact he was quite anti-communist and pro-American, views dating back to his childhood in Japanese-occupied Korea.
Indeed on one occasion, when he and his aircraft were being inspected by Kim Il Sung himself, he seriously thought about just pulling out his pistol and shooting the “Great Leader” right there and then, but he decided against it.
No ended up flying his MiG on many combat missions during the Korean War, but he always held off from actually engaging in air to air combat, partly to avoid getting himself killed and partly so he wouldn’t end up killing any American pilots. No had had dreams to go and live in the United States for a while by this point, but he hid it by essentially appearing to be the most devoted Communist in the entirety of the Second World. He started his own newspaper (Ardently pro-communist) and generally appeared to be every bit the loyal Communist.
Inside however, he was plotting his escape.
In July 1953, after the Korean War finally settled into stalemate around the 38th Parallel, an armistice was signed that ended the war, and established the DMZ around the area of the front at the time.
On the 21st of September 1953, a few months after the end of the war, No Kum Sok was taking off on a routine flight from his airbase, or so everyone thought. In fact, what he was actually doing was stealing his MiG and defecting.
He turned south, and flew across the 38th Parallel. The North Koreans did not attempt to stop him, mostly because he had taken them by surprise and any aircraft they did send to stop him would not have caught him in time, and the Americans did not shoot him down (they did not know of his intentions any more than the North Koreans did) because their radar had been shut off for routine maintanance, which was a stroke of frankly incredible luck for the defector.
Eventually, after 17 minutes of flight, No began to approach an American airbase, the Kimpo airbase which is now the Gimpo international airport. Because he did not really have time to plan his approach properly, No was forced to land facing the wrong way down the runway, forcing another aircraft who was also landing to swerve out of his way at the surprise MiG coming straight at his face.
No landed successfully and immediately jumped out of his plane. He tore up the picture of Kim that he and all North Korean pilots kept in their cockpits before surrendering.

He was eventually awarded the $100,000 reward for his MiG, despite his insistence that he had never even heard such a reward was available and that it was not his motivation for defecting. He eventually realized his ambition of moving to the United States, and he still lives in Florida today.

1,"Here is my personal family story dealing with Mr. Che Guevara.
When I was 2 years old the Cuban Revolution was in full swing. My father was the sort of lawyer people in trouble wanted. One who never billed clients and rarely walked away from a fight. In a landmark case that stunned the nation, 22 survivors of an armed invasion led by Fidel Castro were put on trial for seeking to topple Cuba’s dictator. The event is referred to in Cuban history as Castro’s ‘Granma’ Invasion (and the subsequent Granma Trial). Papa took the case pro bono.
Lucas and Dora Morán, Santiago de Cuba, 1955
 
As attorney for the defense he admitted their guilt. And proclaimed their innocence. “Cuba’s Constitution,” he told the tribunal, “makes it every citizen’s duty to oppose tyranny. Precisely as they have done. Release them. It's not they but Batista who's here on trial.” A forceful defense. So much so the prosecutor walked the length of the court to stand beside him, declaring unwillingness to seek punishment. The lead magistrate voiced the same opinion; he voted to acquit. You can imagine the tumult in that place. The two remaining justices, cowed and fearful, voted to convict. Our trial of the century.
 
When I was 3 dad went into hiding. He didn’t have much choice. The police were after him. Cuba’s dictator didn’t like those courtroom antics. He ordered his assassination. (It was commonplace then.) Dad fled the city, joining Fidel Castro’s rebel army in the Sierra Maestra. Fidel gave him a rifle and commissioned him captain. Every once in a while he’d come down from the Sierra to see us kids. He’d dye his hair blonde, or wear a dark moustache. Always incognito. Because by the time I was 4 papa had analyzed Fidel. He didn't like what he saw: an intelligent, deceitful sociopath of totalitarian pretensions.
Captain Lucas Morán (l.) and Comandante Raúl Castro (r.), in the mountains of the Sierra Cristal, summer of 1958
 
Fidel opened a second front in the mountains of the Sierra Cristal. He put in command his younger brother Raúl, a cruel, despotic little man with distinct Napoleonic tendencies. (Fidel once warned the rebels: “You’d better hope no bullet gets me. Because if it does, you’re going to have him.”)
Things were looking up for the revolution. Government soldiers were surrendering in droves, and one day Comandante Raúl found himself with two hundred captives, no place to jail them, and no guards to watch them. He and Che Guevara together informed Captain Morán they were to be shot. Father was enraged. ‘A criminal act,' he called it. The murder of unarmed men. “Our only legal recourse,” papa told Raúl, “Is their release. They can be paroled to the Catholic church or the Red Cross.” A complicated solution, and not without risk, but it was so done.
With the Army of Liberation in the Sierra Maestra, 1958
Papa then launched a revolution within and against the Revolution. He composed a legal writ. Rebel officers penned their names alongside his. (Raúl was not popular among them, having a sadistic and unsavory reputation.) Papa’s writ is referred to in Cuban history as la ley de los capitanes--‘the captains’ law’. Sort of like a little Cuban Magna Carta, it was our first attempt to curb Castro’s tyranny.
A council of officers will henceforth examine all orders decreed by Comandante Castro. We will veto illegal or immoral commands. Extrajudicial punishment and trial by firing squad will end. Defendants will be given opportunity to present evidence and call witnesses…
Cuba’s rural peasantry was then mired in poverty and illiteracy, a situation best described as feudalism. As the rebels freed vast tracts of the Sierra, land grants were made to sharecroppers in territorio libre de Cuba. A rural literacy campaign brought teacher-volunteers from the cities to teach mountain dwellers their abecedario. Papa saw literacy as a powerful tool against oppression. But he also knew liberation would be short lived, should Castro assume dictatorial powers. “He wants to herd us out of one pen,” he warned fellow officers, “and cage us in another.”
Castro’s answer to ‘the captains’ law’? Capt. Morán was summoned before Raúl and Che Guevara for ‘a frank exchange of ideas’. It proved nothing of the sort. He was arrested. This is war, Che reminded. And in a war, he said, we may send men to the firing squad as we see fit. Evidence is academic. Legal procedures are archaic bourgeois details. The Revolution must have absolute power to coerce and to punish. Raúl accused papa of conspiring against Fidel. ‘This is treason,’ he accused; ‘Treachery, sedition, subversion, betrayal!’ Crimes against the Revolution.
 
A trial was held in the mountains of the Sierra. He was court-martialed. Were it not for his role in the urban resistance, and his following among rebel ranks, he’d have been shot. Instead he was disarmed and sent back to the city. In disgrace, (so they said), there to face Batista’s wrath. Raúl’s operatives then tipped off the dictator’s police. 'A fugitive from justice, the lawyer Lucas Morán, is in central Havana.' Pursued in the mountains as well as the cities, papa faced more than one of Batista's assassins. He evaded several attempts on his life.
When I turned 5 Fidel won the Revolution. I remember the victory parades, army tanks in the street. At the School of Law where he’d once taught papa was tried in absentia. Chief witness for the prosecution was one of his former law students. The young man had served alongside him in Castro's Army of Liberation. His name was Jorge Serguera. Captain Lucas Morán’s little Magna Carta, and his refusal to take part in revolutionary trials (with death by firing squad) were judged ‘counter-revolutionary acts.’ Penalty was death by firing squad.
But papa had made many friends during the revolution. He’d won many courtroom victories, saved a lot of lives. Those people remembered. They sheltered him and helped him flee the country. He made it out of Cuba just in time. The CIA picked him up in New York. As with many Cuban exiles, the agency took a professional interest. That’s when his life started to get interesting.
Comandante/Prosecutor Jorge Serguera at one of his many televised show trials, Havana, 1959
 
Papa’s accuser, Comandante Serguera, was later rewarded with a government ministry. As President of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television he went on to prosecute intellectuals, poets, writers, musicians, long-hairs, dissidents, and homosexuals. As if that weren’t enough, he banned the Beatles from Cuban radio. I contacted him a few years ago. He expressed a desire, through a mutual friend, to meet with me. “Your father was a fine man,” he offered. “A brave man. My role in his affair is completely misunderstood.” He died of cancer before our meeting could take place.
 
Admittedly, this is a story of loss. It’s about a man who loses his home, his family, his livelihood, his fortune, his native land, his native tongue, his revolution, his counter-revolution, his freedom, and (very nearly) his life. While keeping the thing most precious to his heart, to wit, his principles. It starts in Cuba and ends in America, as many good things do.
Modern day enablers paint Che Guevara in heroic terms. That is their myth, and they are welcome to inhabit the myth, should it comfort them. But they must also know that those who condone oppression for the rest, while demanding rights and privileges for themselves, are not men, in the traditional sense. They are less than men, cowards perhaps, children no doubt, enjoying freedoms they never fought for, never bled for, and certainly never won.
***
An addendum
My father was not an easy man to categorize. Eager to take down bullies a notch or two, a brawler and street-fighter by nature, he also despised acts of cruelty. He had a soft spot in his heart for animals of all sort, song-birds in particular.
He was raised in accordance with an unspoken code unknown today. It derives from Spanish chivalry. Honor stood above all else; a man who witnessed a woman assaulted and abused, but took no action, was no longer a man. He was something less. Not all followed this code, of course. Those who did knew where they stood.
The Cuban nation, (he was further taught), is female; like the Virgin herself, Cuba is a woman, beautiful and green, warm and nurturing. She is irreplaceable. An affront to her was an affront to all. And any man who failed to rise in her defense? Well, sad to say, he was no longer a man. He was something far less. There was no deeper shame.
It is not mere metaphor. Our traditions explain (in part) why so many abandoned home and family to join a revolution that paid nothing, and promised nothing, save the possibility of (at best) capture and imprisonment, and (at worst) injury and death. Honor and justice were principal reasons the Cuban Revolution was fought at all.
When the rebels entered Havana at the close of 1958, Che set up headquarters in the ancient Spanish fortress of La Cabaña. For five months he oversaw daily summary trials and consequent executions by firing squad. He enjoyed his work. Batista's army had by then become Fidel's army. Batista's police were now Fidel's police.
Mr. Che Guevara has since transformed into a semi-religious icon. Devotees wear his face across their chest, much like an image of Saint Anthony. Hoc est corpus meum, as we say in the Latin eucharist: “This is the body of Christ.” Upon Che’s unseemly apotheosis, adherents have turned their myth into a holy struggle between the Church of Che and lawless heresy.
Lucas Morán said the worshipful adoration of any political figure, whatever his legacy, must and should raise suspicions in a rational human being. Worship is the conceit of angels, not of men.

2,">Will China eventually break up into several different countries, like the Soviet Union did?
I am from Soviet Union and I can say for sure that it was destroyed not because of problems with economy, our economy was not great but vast majority of Soviet people were absolutely used to it and considered it normal. In many respects it was even better than today, people were relaxed, free medicine and education, rent was almost nil, enough simple food, no cars no traffic and clean air. There was no any upheaval or protests of any significance.
Also, the potential of Soviet socialist economy was absolutely great considering that about 30% of it (and practically 90% of science) worked to provide military parity with West where just around 3–5% of economy was about weapons and army. If our old leaders could stop trying to maintain absolute parity - we would develop faster than China.
USSR became ex-USSR because of money/influence of America and generally West, Gorbachev’s betrayal and stupidity, plus corrupted communist elite decided to convert their power into millions which are much easier to pass to their children than power.
So, the answer is YES, it is possible. All ingredients are there though maybe in different proportions and maybe there is no critical mass to explode the system:
Plus: Chinese send their corrupted officials to jails and latter USSR was not doing that
Plus: Chinese propaganda (in a positive sense) is much better than in late USSR and economical success is helping it of course.
Plus: Chinese are different race and they suffered a lot from English - that helps a lot, Soviet people had no such barrier and were fooled into “friendship” with West.
Minus: money-money-money. Financial system is still controlled by America+Britain and many rich Chinese would prefer to betray China in exchange for saving their accounts. If rich Chinese will get power or powerful ones will get idea to convert their personal power into money - that will be the end of China and its prosperity.
Minus: Western propaganda and its ability to attract stupid young boys who never paid their bills without help from parents.
Hopefully there are more pluses than minuses and China will go ahead instead of being thrown backwards.
P.S. I see that many young Chinese think of China as very prosperous, strong and monolithic country. I can assure you that Soviet people felt exactly the same way about USSR and I am old enough to remember jokes about poor Chinese that were so behind Soviet Union in economy and military strength. Don’t forget how your grandparents lived not so long time ago and for how many years China was in deep shit before it found a way out of it.
The fact is that West is still much richer and has a lot of power to influence and potentially destroy both China and Russia. The main problem is that Western prosperity is a mass-prosperity, they have plenty of rich people who are pretty educated and behave very responsibly despite all this talk about freedom and democracy. Besides, Western elite (real elite, not talking heads like Obama) developed system where nobody disputes their power - in part because nobody really knows who they are, and in part because westerners know that they live much better than Chinese or Russians and so they prefer not to ask real questions, it is enough to know that their elite provides high standard of living - and they don’t care how that is achieved. Basically they know that their system is good because their life is good and non-western countries (from where they suck all goods and resources in exchange for printed paper) simply have BAD system and NO democracy.
So, Western elite and population is REALLY much more monolithic than China and Russia where many people hate their elite because they are poor and elite is super-rich. Also, Chinese/Russians know who rules them - very small group of people whose life and motives are very far from life and motives of average citizen. West has enough resources to simply buy some of them, maybe not today, maybe not even tomorrow… it took several changes of leadership in USSR to find Gorbachev… but these people think long-term, they have huge resources and money to literally grow traitors. It took 23 years to grow a new generation of young idiots in Ukraine for example. They financed this process FOR MANY years - and it finally worked. If Chinese think that there is a big difference between Russians and Ukrainians - they are mistaken, 25 years ago there was no difference at all. It is now.
Also, think about mentality of top communists in China. Chinese love their families and children, right? What is better for children (especially if they are not as bright as father): to be a super-powerful communist leader or a simple ordinary multi-billionaire with many reliable accounts in Western banks? The latter means - Dynasty! And super-power can’t be reliably passed to children and even more so to grandchildren etc.
Don’t underestimate West, especially English/Americans, they know how to find cracks and infect whole countries with lethal viruses which will not kill Russia or China of course - but can make them very sick and weak for a long time. Remember opium? Now it is Hollywood, porn, Internet, mass-media etc. They still control a lot and will control in near future. Never relax, don’t stop executing corrupted officials and don’t forget to deprive their children and relatives of all money and generally good future. Healthy universal hatred of West is also helpful, don’t forget to cultivate it on all levels of your society even if it hurts business :) Trust me, such simple humanitarian things are MUCH MORE important for prosperity of country than stocks, investments, exchange rates etc.
Added after reading comments: I agree that late Soviet Union was not as attractive as West, it was as poor as for example today’s Spain compared to Switzerland. However, I don’t see how disintegration of country and all business processes could possibly help to improve lives of ordinary people. Most westerners are not aware what degree of poverty we experienced in 1990’s as a result of all these new borders, custom duties, different currencies etc. Any high-tech product like airplanes was made in several USSR republics and this cooperation was disrupted after all these republics became separate countries.
It was necessary to reform USSR like China was reformed, and that required unity and strong leadership, not Gorbachev’s betrayal and disintegration of great country to please West. Actually, the success of independent Putin’s Russia as well as success of independent Kazakhstan and Belarus (all 3 presidents are labeled as “dictators”), as well as failure of those who agreed (or was coerced) to follow West (Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, Serbia, depopulated Baltic republics etc.) show what is the right strategy.
Of course, China is the best example of rapid development and their experience should be studied and followed. Besides, it is so much easier to work with China because Chinese don’t package their recipes together with LGBT, political demands, don’t teach “democracy” and ”human rights” while bombing and organizing coups across the globe.
Though to say the truth, Russia developed not much slower than China when oil prices were high, and it made little sense to care about production of goods when it was so easy to drill and buy goods abroad. Now we have different situation with oil and gas, so Russia will diversify its economy of course, and weakened ruble will help to compete internationally. Please don’t stop western sanctions! They really help to develop local production and strengthen cooperation with China and generally with growing Asia :)
Added more after reading comments:
>I feel sorry that you feel that you need to “hate” the west!
I am well aware that there are bad and good people everywhere. However, good western people don’t define politics and international affairs. Good western people somehow did not prevent tragedies of American Indians, millions dead from famines in India and opium trade in China. Quite the opposite, these good people benefited from collective looting of these people. In 1990s the entire West benefited from looting of former USSR when we became extremely poor and suffered from cold and problems with electricity while so-called Russian oligarchs channeled abroad all natural resources (oil, gas, coal etc.) and money from their sale into western banks. Yes, I saw some western people who were genuinely concerned about that but they don’t define politics and they elect politicians who well provide them at expense of others. Watch this interview and maybe you will understand why for us it is so much better to be an open enemy than hope to befriend you:

3,"Pretty far. Most people don’t understand how close it was during the Missile Crisis. Consider this:
It’s October of 1962 and the United States and the Soviet Union have been growling at each other over the island of Cuba for about a week now. The Soviets have SS-4 Sandal missiles with multi-megaton warheads on the island as well as a bunch of tactical nuclear weapons to fend off any US invasion. Americans know about the missiles but not the tactical weapons. Kennedy views the missiles as destabilizing and is willing to go to war to get them out.
In an effort to avoid war, the United States has a cordon of warships blocking sea-lanes to the island and has placed Cuba under “quarantine.” American warships have orders to board and search ships with force if necessary.
The American and Soviet militaries are on high alert; bombers sit with live nuclear weapons in their bays, missiles are fueled and ready for launch. The Strategic Air Command has taken itself to DEFCON-2 — just one step short of war. It is the opinion of the military commanders that the sooner the shooting starts the more favorable it will be for the United States; they are actively trying to start a war.
It is in this atmosphere that a US destroyer detects a Soviet submarine between two cargo ships which are headed toward the quarantine line. With the sub submerged it’s not safe to board the cargo ships so the destroyers begin trying to force it to the surface by dropping sounding charges — small explosives which, in theory, can’t harm the sub.
On board the sub this is not at all clear. Moscow has not been in contact for a number of days, it’s unclear if a state of war exists between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the explosions in the water sound very much like real depth charges. Temperatures in the sub top 100 fahrenheit and the American ships on the surface vastly outnumber the submarine and his (Soviet subs are male by convention) squad-mates.
The captain decided that he would use his “special weapon” — a T-5 nuclear torpedo. The United States did not know, at the time, that Soviet subs carried nuclear weapons but, believing himself outnumbered and perhaps already at war, Captain Valentin Savitsky ordered the launch. He sought and received approval from his second in command. The submarine B-59 would engage the American carrier group with its nuclear tipped torpedo and would vaporize the squadron.
But B-59 was the lead boat in the flotilla and, as such, had aboard Vice Admiral Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov. As commander of the flotilla, the weapon could not be launched without his permission and he refused to give it.
What exactly happened on B-59 will probably never be known. The captain and he Vice Admiral were raked over the proverbial coals when they returned home. Their boat was never searched, but it was forced to the surface and the Soviet navy considered that within a hair’s breadth of treason. As a result, the records of the exact nature of the events on board will forever be tinged with the threat of execution or exile hanging in the air over those who witnessed it.
But we do know this: had the torpedo on B-59 been fired, had Arkhipov not refused to allow it, the United States would have lost a carrier group at sea to a nuclear detonation right off the coast of Florida in the most charged and bellicose moment of the Cold War. It is difficult - no, impossible - to imagine that Arkhipov’s decision did not avert a global thermonuclear war.
In October 1962, all that stood between humanity and the abyss was one man, out of touch with his government, sleep deprived, suffering from heat exhaustion, in a steel tube hundreds of feet underwater with explosives raining down on him from above.

4,"Since around 1970ties, those borders were kinda open for a large part of the Polish population. Other East Block populations faced, in general, more practical restrictions.
You still needed a passport (or equivalent) to cross. Soviet Union would allow only a short term near-border (48hrs?) trips. And there were custom controls between countries.
That passport thing was the key. You had to take it from the police station for every trip, you had to return it afterwards. And they would give it to you or not, arbitrarily. Police used that as one of ways to control the behavior of people. Ruffle feathers, get locked inside your country.
Because the Soviet proxy Polish government was relatively “liberal”, millions of Poles were roaming East Block countries and making a steal in arbitrage (prices of goods). Other East Block citizens were more cut-off from this earning opportunity. This gave the Poles a significant leg-up after 1989, a large segment of the Polish population had some (laughable, but still) accumulated capital, many years of trading experience, and contacts. We talk millions of people.
Prices for goods in the East Block countries were set to “morally justified” values. This is socialism for you. As in each country “what is fair/justified” was a bit different, prices and availability were widely different. You could trade, enormous (percentage) profits, with half a brain and a whole bottle of vodka to make up for a lack of language skills. Amazing how languages are easy after a shot or two of a liquor.
You just needed to be able to cross the border.

6,"There is a common denominator for all radical Socialist projects:
Sooner, or later, they all run out of money.
The Chinese answer to that was extremely pragmatic: let’s make some money, and see what happens.
We ran out of money in the 1980s, too. Yet, Gorbachev and Co. didn’t make the Chinese decision, which an entire Russia is now bemoaning. The reason for that bemoaning getting stronger year after year is that new generations of Russians are entering the public space and the Internet. More and more of us don’t know what the political scene and the public mood was like in the 1980s.
I know how it was, I was near the center of it. I can confirm that the Chinese option was totally out of question.
Why? Plain and simple: national divisions.
China has remained a national state even throughout the Communist rule. Russia has never been a national state. The Soviet Union was an empire, held together by the all-encompassing Communist idea.
If you try to mend the edifice of a Communist empire by introducing free enterprise, after decades of killing and imprisoning people for even a glimpse of a bourgeois thought, you start picking apart its foundation.
Remember that a lot of my powerful comrades were comfortably living in this magnificent castle. We had the world-class army and the unsurpassed secret police who seemed to have a firm grip on everything. And while people in the provinces were hurting, at the top nothing changed in their lifestyle.
Why run out in the cold, if your house isn’t on fire?
That’s why Gorbachev tried to start refurbishing the property by taking down some of the red interiors. He didn’t see the deep connection between the interiors and the foundation. He started talking about “common human values”, and convinced everyone that Communists were not going to kill people any longer.
Once that happened, the cash-strapped ethnic elites around the empire started asking: what do we have to lose? The Russians are broke, they are weak, there’s no more money coming in sight from Moscow, hey, what are we waiting for?
And the hell started. Tbilisi, Sumgait, Baku, Nagorno-Karabakh, Vilnius, everywhere.

8,"Artillery, absolutely no doubt about it.
Capable of decimating hundreds of lives in the blink of an eye, a single well-placed shell can (and has) been the cause of some of the most terrifying acts of violence in history.
When I use the term artillery I include the Napoleonic war-era pieces onwards to the second world war, but they they have been used to devastating effect in Vietnam, Korea as well as the Bosnian-Serbian Civil war.
Lets look at the Battle of Waterloo since most are familiar with it:
Napoleon fielded just over 250 guns, with size varying from your small maneuverable 6 pounders to the brutally powerful 12 pounder field guns. The Allies (British, Prussians and Dutch) fielded some 150 guns of similar performance.
For reference a 12-pounder gun firing projectiles of 4.1 kg fired the projectile with a kinetic energy of 240,000 joules. This solid projectile would often be “skipped” across the field to fly through a formation of infantry, tearing through the ranks indiscriminately, fired from up to a kilometer away. However canister (or grape) shot was by far the scariest thing around, a package or tin of over 100 musket balls was fired at infantry within 400 yards like a giant shotgun, literally tearing through a swathe of bodies - all the infantry could do was reform ranks and keep marching.
12-pounder canister used in the American civil war.
But that’s not all…
Shrapnel shot was used by the British forces at the battle, exploding and fragmenting on impact or timer at the French lines advancing across the fields. It was one of the first major battles shrapnel had been used - and it scared the living daylights out of the French assaulting the ridge.
Now for a more recent and possibly just as pivotal war, the American Civil War:
Whilst the Napoleonic era had cemented the use of mass artillery batteries to support ones own soldiers and decimate the enemy, artillery had never quite been so useful until US politicians decided to send their sons to settle their arguments with blood. Artillery had grown ever more diverse and deadly at that point, and both sides were competitively straining to provide bigger and more powerful pieces to decimate their cousins with. Thus the widespread use of the massive 12 pounder guns, as well as the terrifying mortars and howitzers introduced but not quite refined during the Napoleonic era. (Of course the weapons were used to great effect in those years, but bear with me.)
A selection of shells used by the US artillery at the time. I am assuming this was for Union forces, but both sides had such ordnance available.
The important thing about this war was not quite the casualty count here, which were much lower than those caused by rifle and close combat - but the ordnance. Foreign representatives of a dozen countries attended these battles as observers to witness a turning point of modern military innovation. Shrapnel and high explosive shells were commonplace and some of the first Rifled Guns (cannon and small arms alike) were used to effectively out-range their smooth-bore counterparts. European observers took note, as can be seen next.
World War 1. The Great War. The war to end all wars… *sigh*
Over the past few years I have spent a great deal of time analysing and reading about this war, but one thing that I cannot convey enough is the sheer scale of violence experienced. We are not talking pea-shooters anymore, we are not talking line-of-sight firing positions; we are talking these:
One of the first Big Bertha (M-Gerät) Howitzers used by the Central Powers. It fired a 820kg shell, capable of firing up to 12.5km in range. Whilst predominantly used for cracking battlefield hardpoints - this is the level at which we are dealing with here.
British Mk1 18-Pounder field gun, the most widespread field artillery used at the time. High explosive, shrapnel and armor piercing were it’s mainstay - with timers and fuses available to improve effectiveness.
Now that we have had a small glimpse at the toys available, it’s time for us to understand the effect of such weapons.
Verdun.
Never have I studied such incredible horrors - and the immense bravery in the face of such.
The German forces decided that the region of Verdun, where the French lines lay, was to be a point of focus for one of their grandest offensives ever seen in the war. Over 1200 guns were assembled for the purposes of breaking the French, with 1 000 000 shells fired over the course of a 10 hour bombardment. Remember Big Bertha, 26 of those were used to target the fort and city of Verdun alone. Men died in their tens of thousands, before a single rifle was fired. Lung-melting gas, shrapnel, high explosive and bunker-bashing AP rounds shredded the French lines over a ten hour bombardment.
It is estimated that over a third of all French frontline troops were killed from artillery alone, buried in their own guts and comrades, without ever glimpsing their enemy. The use of mortars and super-heavy artillery was the main focus for the Germans as it enabled them to lob explosives into the trench-lines, raining fire from above and bypassing most line-of-sight cover of the troops.
Fort Douaumont before the battle.
Douaumont after the battle. It was taken by German forces and later recaptured by the French.
The casualties expressed by the overall toll of the battle reflects quite accurately the devastation caused by the artillery used. The Germans experienced the loss of 143 000 soldiers killed, and the French 163 000 killed and over 200 000 wounded, however one needs to understand that the French were DEFENDING. French troops had the advantage of their own defensive positions and familiar territory, as well as fall-back positions and redoubts. The German artillery (and ground forces of course) were so brutal that a whole 5km of frontline was taken in two days, with only 600 men being lost on the first assault. The damage was not just to soldiers’ bodies - but their minds; with communication lines damaged during bombardment the French were subject to absolute chaos as high command could not effectively coordinate the beleaguered soldiers. This is where some of the most eye-wateringly brave stories emerge, where decimated forces simply refused to retreat - and held their ground beyond any hope of success.
With the barrages lasting day and night, the rumbles are reported to have been heard over 160km away. One can hardly hear a car backfire over 300m, imagine over 100km…
Over the course of the war artillery was by far the greatest killer; with about 58.3 percent of all German deaths attributed, compared to about 41.7 percent by small arms fire. These values even further change when considering the trench warfare, where casualties as a result of artillery fire reached over 75% in some cases, the frontline of Verdun being one of them.
In summary
One can easily argue that small arms, such as rifles have caused the most military deaths, and it would be a close contender - but when it comes to the post-industrial revolution wars high explosives and fragmentation fired from some sort of artillery (field guns, howitzers and mortars) are paramount. One needs to also note that tanks carry artillery cannon, simply modified then mounted and carried into battle as a mobile and armored force. Tanks often play the role as mobile field guns in modern wars and the use of ship-mounted guns and torpedo launchers really don't have any other category than artillery. Anti-aircraft guns are artillery emplacements as well, and ultimately anything bigger than your Heaviest machine guns (20mm +) almost move into the artillery category - although tanks technically fall under the armored cavalry title.
Huge Note: I basically spent an hour writing an essay to myself apparently because the question asked for Infantry-specific and not general weaponry. Realised this AFTER writing the summary. Had fun writing it, really, so can only have a laugh and submit my answer regardless!

10,"Before you call it “over the top”, consider this: it was the first modern marketing campaign, and the most successful ever, by far.
From the moment Lenin decided to call his party “The Majority Party” (better known in Russian, “Bolsheviks”), they were aware of the need for a strong popular appeal with a coherent graphical profile. They hammered it home relentlessly, and their posters were at the forefront of contemporary art: futuristic, geometric, showing what the bright future would be like.
Look at their political achievements in marketing and business terms. Originally, they were banned on their home market. Through ingenious marketing, they managed to gain a monopoly, not only on their home market, but also on several foreign markets. They actually made important inroads on most markets in the world. They also bankrupted two of their three main competitors and forced them out of business.
And still today, millions of people buy the product, despite the manufacturers having admitted over 25 years ago that the package was empty all along.
If that’s not marketing genius, I don’t know what is.

Airborne troops in the Soviet Union were the most famous, the baddest troops. They were frequently featured in the movies. Every boy wanted to have the blue berets and their special blue striped t-shirts.
Once, after watching one of these movies, I told my aunt that I wanted to jump with a parachute. My aunt explained to me that it was possible once I became older. She could even show me where i can go and register for a club. In fact, she told me that she used to jump when she was young. Imagine, my aunt, from a boring middle aged woman, suddenly became the coolest person I know.
So, I was waiting impatiently until I became older. Unfortunately, that day never come. Soviet Union collapsed and Mongolia declared itself a democracy. The first decades were tough and all the stupid ideas about jumping somehow disappeared.I forgot about this childhood dream.
Just recently, I found out that a distant friend, became a member of a parachute society in Mongolia. He posted happy people jumping and enjoying themselves. Suddenly, I remembered my childhood dream.
I told my wife that I want to jump. My wife looking sweetly said: I want my children to grow up knowing their father, not the portrait on the wall. Damn, that was a hit below my belt. Someday… :-)

13,"Actually, we did in fact destroy them -- economically. Yeltsin, backed by the USA, turned Russia into a smoking ruin in the 1990’s, with an inflation rate at one point of 2500 percent, life expectancy dropping like a stone, and people losing the benefits they once had under the Communist state. I have a Russian friend who escaped his country's destitution in its most desperate hour in the 1990’s -- he lived homeless in the streets of New York for a year before he was able to pull his life together and eventually get his own condo out here in Los Angeles. A very tough cookie.
Journalist and author of many books F William Engdahl provides some historical background to the period:
""At the end of the 1980s, the major banks of Wall Street – Wells Fargo, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bank of America – they were all, in 1989, defacto bankrupt, insolvent.
“At that point, something very interesting happened. The Communist government of Poland collapsed, and a trade-union-based organization called Solidarnosc, supported by the Reagan administration, supported by the CIA as well as the Polish Pope John Paul the 2nd, elected a non-communist government, the first domino in the Warsaw Pact to collapse. And it wasn’t long before November 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell down. And George Soros and Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard, with Larry Summers coordinating the show under the Clinton administration, began the looting of Poland with “shock therapy”, as Jeffrey Sachs called it – the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, but above all the looting of the crown jewel of the whole thing, what was now the Russian Federation.
“Boris Yeltsin was brought in with the help of a group of corrupted KGB generals that had contact with the western CIA services, and literally became billionaires in return for selling out their country. They developed a group of young entrepreneurs, mostly in their early 20s, the oldest of whom was 42 -- his name was Boris Berezovsky, and linked them up with western banks – Riggs Bank of Washington DC, which was well known since the 1950s as a CIA bank. Riggs Bank set up a branch in Geneva for money laundering called Riggs-Valmet. And the Russian oligarchs that were being created by these KGB generals would literally steal the assets, under the Yeltsin regime. Yeltsin was their man, he was told his family would become fabulously wealthy if he played the game, which he did.
“The oil and gas resources of the Russian Federation were looted in a fraudulent privatization. Inflation went up to 2,500 percent at one point, and the ruble was completely worthless – that was part of the strategy, so that dollars could buy and did buy any and every asset that was worth buying. And George Soros and his friends, Ronald Lauder and others, came in and began plundering the Russian economy.
“The money was laundered through Switzerland, the Bank of New York, the Isle of Man, and other offshore centers. This was the real origin of the so-called Russian organized crime. It was called the Russian Mafia – it was indeed a mafia. But it was these KGB generals that had sold out their country – 300 senior KGB officers involved in the plot fled Russia and were given US residency status outside of Washington in Virginia, and permanent, very, very cushy pensions. It was a small price to pay for the billions they had helped to loot.
“And the looting of Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation during the 90s kept the Wall Street game afloat for another decade.”

Intrinsic inefficiencies and overall rigidity of Communist countries meant that sooner or later all of them run out of money. They no longer have resources for at the same time maintaining the normal functioning of civil economy (read: feeding and sheltering people) and running the enormous military-industrial complex.
When you are a Communist leader who stands before the till and breaks out in cold sweat seeing only small change, you have three choices:
Keep the military running and screw the population. They’ll manage themselves on water, cabbage and ground tree bark. When they start making noises, you quiet it all down by a combination of blood-letting and strangulation. Don’t be stingy on ammo.
Abandon the Communist project. Keep the power, but let people do things, sell and buy things free, get rich. You tax them, and use the proceeds to keep your military going.
Pull the plug on the military. Don’t shoot people, don’t starve them. Pray to the gods of Communism that a wonder happens, and money starts coming to your coffers, so that you again can feed people and run your military at the same time.
Option 1: North Korea in 1990s, USSR from the end of 1920s onward
Option 2: China in 1978, Vietnam in 1990s, the USSR in 1921 (NEP policy), Cuba kind of opting for it right now.
Option 3: Yugoslavia and USSR in 1991
Now, conclusion.
If you want to carry on the flame of Communism and class struggle for the best of all humanity, always go for Option 1. If power is most important for you, no matter what color it is, go for Option 2.
Never ever go for Option 3. You may get a Nobel prize and a couple of appreciative postings on Quora, but most people who will remember your name are going to come to your grave only to spit on it.

15,"A cynic would ask “how did they rig the modelling to get the A-10s to last that long?”
With its declared intention to make gun attacks on Warsaw Pact armoured units fighting Big Mistake 3, this meant the A-10 would have been repeatedly flying straight, predictable strafing runs while in effective range of:-
12.7mm heavy machine guns (one on the turret of every tank). The A-10 was designed to survive (though not ignore) hits from these and the larger 14.5mm HMG, and they’re manually aimed so not going to get many hits (though there are many of these guns…)
SA-7, SA-14 and SA-16 man-portable SAMs. The A-10 was designed to have a reduced infrared signature as protection from the SA-7, but the Gimlet and Grouse had more sensitive, cooled seekers which could lock onto it and hit it with frequently fatal results. An A-10 might limp back to base after a MANPADS hit but it would not fly again soon and it certainly would be out of the war.
Self-propelled AA guns accompanying the enemy battalions. The ZSU-23–4 had four 23mm cannon, able to fire 4,000rpm (in short bursts, but it’s an AA weapon) with a built-in Gun Dish radar to help it find and engage targets. Proven highly effective in Vietnam and especially the Middle East, by the 1980s this was a very capable system and a lethal threat to any aircraft flying into its range.
By the 1980s this was being replaced by the 2S6 Tunguska, which had better radars, twin 30mm cannon, and eight SA-11 missiles (command guided to 4–5 mile range) in one lethal package, specifically designed to engage attack helicopters and low-flying aircraft.
SA-9 and SA-13 vehicle-mounted SAMs - covering the manoeuvre battalions, the SA-9 was like the SA-7 a limited threat to an A-10, but the SA-13 had a much improved seeker and, again, posed a serious threat (in 1991 at least two A-10s were downed and a third crippled by SA-13).
But the fun hasn’t stopped, because those tank and motor-rifle regiments are operating under cover of more layers of air defence.
SA-8 Gecko vehicles, with command-guided missiles, filled the gap between “point defence” and “area defence” systems, being both mobile (including amphibious) and having a good engagement range (out to ten miles if an opponent were incautious enough to expose themselves), they would deploy to ensure that no gaps opened up in the front’s air-defence coverage as it advanced or if other systems were destroyed.
The Army divisions also deployed SA-6 Gainful systems, which - again - had proved lethally effective in 1973. Mobile on tracked chassis (though taking some time to set up and break down, hence the SA-8 providing mobile cover) the SA-6 was able to engage from treetop height to over 50,000 feet and out to ranges of twenty miles.
Flying through that lot would be extremely dangerous. Flying through it at 300 knots, instead of supersonic or nearly so, even more so. And flying back and forth, climbing to find targets, making gun or Maverick runs, overflying the target’s friends and circling for the next pass… was not a recipe for long life or happiness.
The A-10 - designed for counter-insurgency work in a conflict like Vietnam - was basically a low-level target drone to many of these systems, particularly if it flew at low level and kept having to climb to find targets and either lock on Mavericks or use its gun. The A-10 could hope to avoid or outfly older parts of the air defences - early model (vacuum tube!) ZSU-23–4, SA-7s with uncooled seekers, SA-6 which had a (low, but not non-existent) minimum altitude - but as SA-13, 2S6, SA-8 and improved MANPADS appeared, its life expectancy plummeted.
The Soviets took (and the Russians still take) the threat of air attack on their formations very seriously. A single Russian motor-rifle brigade today will have six SA-13 and twelve SA-15 vehicles, sixteen 2S6 air-defence vehicles (gun and missile), and widely-distributed MANPADs. (http://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Do...) - it’s just not often understood how much air-defence firepower Soviet-era divisions deployed.

16,"During the early 60s ( The Bay of Pigs & Cuban Missile Crisis ) the threat was from the Atomic bomb. Our parents remembered WW2, and everyone took the threat seriously. Unlike today, when they naysayers don’t even believe that there was a holocaust and that somehow, nuclear war is survivable. Then, people stored extra provisions in their basements, and practiced “Duck & Cover” drills at school. Some invested in “Bomb Shelters” and there were sirens in each community ready to sound the warning to take cover. Today, more people are worried about having an extra bag of “grass” on hand, than any device that would filter water.
Back then, we knew who the enemy was, it was the Russians! We knew that death would be coming from the sky, in the form of an Atomic Bomb, and we understood that there would be death and vast destruction. Today, Nobody can be sure just “Who” the enemy is, how, when, where, why, …or if we will be attacked and if we are, for what reason. A “Terrorist Attack” could involve anything from an airliner crashing into a skyscraper, to a computer hacker taking down the electrical grid, It can be a gas attack in the subway, a mass shooting at a music concert, or any of a thousand other smaller attacks in shopping malls, schools, city streets, public areas, amusement parks, dams, utilities, or facilities. It can come from any individual, or group, inside or outside the US, and we will likely have no warning, no responsibility, and no recourse.
As children in the 60s, we were “Americans” first. That’s not the case anymore. Our high school athletes take a knee when our anthem is played, our kids no longer pledge allegiance to America, they learn “War” from video games, and association with friends and groups like AntiFA, BLM, Black Panthers, gangs, even Facebook and other propaganda providers/secular organizations. Even some churches openly condemn America and call for it’s destruction, and today we have a Democrat congresswoman who openly calls for “Attacks against people who support the President.” Hollywood Awards night has become an opportunity for the “Rich Elite” of America to assemble and utter verbal filth, threats, and make disparaging remarks about the President. (Michael Moore recently said “I will bring down Trump before November” ..what does that mean? Bring him down, how? ) With so many undefined threats and enemies fighting inside and outside America, there is no way to know..from where an attack may come, and/or in what form it might take.
To the question: How does it compare? It is Worse now, much worse.
We are Not united as a Nation for a common cause
We are Not prepared or educated in what to do. ( safety, reporting, decontamination, first aid, etc. )
We do Not know from where the attack may .come.
We lack the cohesive/community spirit to stand together
We scream “AT” each other and do not communicate
Many millenials don’t have the basic skills to survive w/out electricity
We no longer “Save” nor “Store” anything in sufficient quantity for the future.
Most millenials lack the ability and initiative to repair/construct anything usable. They live in a “Throw away” society.
The non-military nature of our country ( one half of one percent have served ) tells me that our city streets may be “protected” by people carrying guns who have no professional experience, training, or discipline. While it is true that we have Combat veterans in this country who are willing to take a stand, we have millions of “Call of Duty” video game trained civilians who are now old enough to own guns and who are prone to panic and wrongful, dangerous, and acts for personal gain if things get “Ugly.” That was not the case during the 1960s.
As for my “Preps”, I have adopted the 1960s protocols. I moved out of the city, I have a well-stocked basement, my own generator, well & septic, and I am prepared to protect myself and my family, PERIOD. I have parts on hand to keep my equipment operational, medical supplies, and plenty of books and amusements to keep me entertained and to guide me though the things I may have to do in the future. “An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure” I am now free to enjoy my life. I don’t need to “Bug Out” or “Get away” I am “Away.”

Dude…
Imagine you participate in a boxing match. You’re evenly matched with your opponent, but after a couple of rounds, during a pause between rounds, your opponent receives a phonecall and…. commits suicide. Right there on the ring. The corpse is carried away and the match is over.
Does this count as victory? As you haven’t defeated the opponent with your own skill, I’d say no.
That’s what happened in Cold War. While the west loves attributing this as a victory, when one side commits suicide they simply remove themselves from the conflict thus denying you a chance to win… that doesn’t sound like a “victory” for me.
As for the “made us think we won”.
1990s in Russia royally sucked. Unrest, uncertainty, chaos, organized and not so organized crime, chechen war, terrorist attacks, catastrophes.

18,"Discarded body of the VVA-14 Ekranoplan.
Looking like a child took key components of planes, the wings, the engines, and the hull, and either randomly placed them all over the plane, or stretched them out of proportion, or even took ship parts and just strapped them on (the missiles), the Soviet Ekranoplans were one of the most remarkable yet enigmatic weapons of the Cold War.
This is the Lun-class ekranoplan, AKA the gargantuan Soviet flying boat with massive missiles on top.
Ekranoplans are based around the ground effect, (where flying close to the ground, or water can increase lift, thus allowing vehicles of epic dimensions to sail several meters above the water at tremendous speeds that ships could never dream of reaching), thus are called GEVs (Ground Effect Vehicles).
Normal
Ground effect
The Lun was truly massive, 73 meters in length and sporting a 44 meter wingspan, dimensions that only GEVs can achieve. The weirdness of the Soviet Ekranoplans are unlimited. The Lun can achieve speeds of 550 kilometers per hour, and has a payload capacity of 100 tonnes, along with six massive Moskit anti-ship missiles, making the Lun an attack focused vehicle.
Next, up, is the Lun’s much more famous and much bigger brother, the KM.
Dubbed the Caspian Sea Monster, this 92 meter long beast was a mystery to the west. After it’s discovery by the west, NATO frantically tried to figure out its purpose.
It was just a prototype (its name translating to “Ship Prototype”).
But it was no less amazing, claiming the name of largest aircraft in the world, for decades before another Russian aircraft stole its name.
After 15 years of testing in its namesake, the Caspian Sea, a pilot error caused the beast to be severely damaged in a crash that resulted in no human injury, but wounds to the KM so heavy she was never repaired (it was a financial dead end as well, so the Soviet navy would probably have given up on it regardless), and left to sink a week later.

19,"Few details
It was public service - everything. Practically everyone was a salaried employee, even plumbers and waiters.
Soviet propaganda was praising USSR for distributing most of the wealth in non-monetary form. It was the access to that non-monetary things that were valued often ahead of salary - ability to receive housing (most was Government housing) in reasonable timeframe, ability to buy a car at official price, holidays, you name it.
In addition to the official distribution of wealth, there was unofficial - ""taking from work"" aka stealing. The scale you cannot imagine - at the official Moscow white-water slalom championship, not a single craft was made from materials that could be legally bought. Some parts I believe meant to fly into space.
Every organisation had a First Department, handling security, censorship and spying over employees - usually headed by an ex-KGB.
Bathrooms were shocking, and there was no such thing as kitchens at work. You want to make yourself tea or coffee, you go fill the kettle from the toilet sink. Occasionally nauseating.
Following up on sickening, Communist Party activists were doing their things with ""political information"" aka propaganda etc
Workplace was highly diversified up to the certain level. Nearly all adult women were working.
Women could even be seen doing heavy physical work, like road or railway maintenance. The Soviet system would pay them the same money for lesser productivity - say less volume dug.
Comes Autumn, every white-collar employee would remember where their gum boots, gloves and rain gear are - they were about to be sent to harvest potato and other vegetables, and no gear was provided. Once again, no discrimination on gender basis - a Ph.D.-qualified mother of three would go just as well, leaving the kid for her husband who would do the next 2-week shift.
As soon as security clearance (""dopusk"") comes into play, things gets immensely complicated. Like say how important was to keep as a state secret what Research Institute for Automatics was doing, considering it was described in details in In the First Circle widely sold in the West, and it doesn't take a genius to make a connection considering the location is specified? Yet employees would get their individual entry and exit times, so American spies won't guess how many people work there. I was lucky to avoid all that stuff.
There was a universally understood term ""to work in a box"", as been employed by an organisation that is to be referred by its PO Box number.
Getting anything done in the ""planned economy"" was a major problem, as money didn't really mean much on B2B level. Most things were done through exchange of favors and products.
One particular product, which was supplied to organisations that needed it, stood aside - ethanol aka ""liquid currency"". If you have it, a lot of small problems could be easily solved.
Salaries were rather ridiculous - a  basic Lada cost 3-year salary of an engineer. However even for that much, they still were distributed via employers - a new car on the black market would cost double that.
More on salaries. Artificially set prices were creating some bizarre effects. A pair of US-made jeans would cost over 6 week salary. A 100% wool suit would cost half that.
Anything to do with travelling abroad was creating immediate stream of income eclipsing salary, through buying stuff abroad, then selling it. However to have money to stock up on stuff, lucky travelers had to save on food, bringing everything with them and saving daily allowance. The urban legends about classic musicians cooking soup in washbasins using waterboilers [1] were abound.
The cases of sexual harassment etc could not go to court, however could be dealt with by the local Party committee if the offender was a Party member.
The need to be a Communist to have a management career was creating some bizarre situations. As I understand, because it was a Party of Proletariat, there was a quota for white collar workers - it had to remain majority blue-collar. So in organisations with little blue-collar employees like design bureaus, career-minded educated young men would chase drunk plumbers and handymen (those would be salaried employees of the same organisations, and counted as proletarians) begging them to join the Party thus creating an extra spot for a white-collar member.
For the same reason, some people including some [ex-]Presidents of post-Soviet states started their careers as factory floor workers after getting their degrees - to join the Party as Proletarians, not to learn the industry bottom-up.
There were no concepts like resume, there were no employment agents. In a bus you would see an ad inviting you to become a bus driver - and that about it. Practically any job, except for a graduate position after a college, was found through your network.
After receiving free education (with an extra serve of mandatory indoctrination, and military training if male), one was supposed to work for three years where told. 
The behavior of recruiters talking to fresh graduates makes Western used car dealers look honest. Me and my mate were promised to be sent to the space station, in addition to medals and housing, if we just sign on the dotted line that we agree to work in the particular ""Box""
The need for our agreement (which we refused to give) was due to rather unique circumstances. In general it would be quite close to a slave market - graduates would go where told.

21,"The Soviets aimed nukes at a hot dog stand.
In their defense, it wasn’t just any hot dog stand, it was this one:
Supposedly, using satelite imagery, the Soviet Union could monitor traffic and human activity in and around the Pentagon, and they found that at certain times a large percentage of people were clustered around this structure. Also, as it is right in the center of the complex, the Soviets presumed it was of utmost importance, the entrance to a secret underground bunker.
Later, it gained the nickname “Ground Zero”, the deadliest hot dog stand in the world.
An 18-year-old German aviator flew his prop plane right next to Red Square, evading all of the Soviet air defenses.
Mathias Rust flew this right through the USSR’s “impenetrable” air defenses, evading intercepters (that never received orders to kill him, often mistaking him as a friendly), and, in an attempt to reduce tensions between the east and the west, landed his plane at Vasilevsky Descent, right next to Red Square. This incident led to multiple air command seniors to be fired. He was sentenced to 4 years of jail, but pardoned in his 14th month, which is ironic, because some loyal citizens of the USSR got off way worse.

22,"Good question. Perhaps, personally for me the first real sign, that the USSR crumbles, became the disappearance of goods from stores.
Soviet stores never had a rich assortment, but there was a minimal set of basic foods you could buy, and very cheap: bread, milk, pasta, some canned foods. I got used to them for many years, they were always on the shelves and always cost the same.
""Always"" - I literally mean my entire life by the time (21 year). Every child in the USSR knew that a package of milk ALWAYS costs 36 kopecks (1/100 of rouble), a kilogram of potatoes - 10 kopecks, and a small round bun - 3 kopecks, small ice cream 8 kopecks and big one - 48.
And then one day I came to the store, and these goods disappeared! It didn't have anything on the shelves, and I stood there in complete confusion.
Moscow, 1991
And in few days goods appeared again, but became much, MUCH more EXPENSIVE. For the USSR it was unthinkable, but it happened.

24,"After the Berlin Wall fell in late-1989, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher hoped that Gorbachev shared her interest in keeping Germany divided. She tried to use her personal relationship with the Soviet leader in the same way she had used her closeness to the American President Ronald Reagan. Thatcher encouraged Gorbachev to block what US President George HW Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were proposing for Germany’s future. The reality was, and Thatcher quickly learned this, that Gorbachev was not concerned about what Britain wanted, and the USSR was too weak in any case to apply its power in Central Europe. Thatcher continued to argue that merging East and West Germany had disadvantages for the EU (still then the EC), NATO, and German democracy, but all this accomplished was to anger the Germans and make her own Conservative Party doubt her judgement on European matters.
Thatcher also sought an alliance with French President Francois Mitterrand on Germany. He was more receptive than Gorbachev. France, as one of the four occupying powers, had a technical say in the matter, but Mitterand had to know as well as Thatcher did that France and Britain lacked the power to override the United States—as well as the will of the two Germanys' citizens. Mitterrand told Thatcher he opposed a united Germany, and, knowing his biography as a World War II French resistance leader, one can understand why. However, Mitterrand soberly accepted the diplomatic damage that would come from opposing German unification. France had little to gain from upsetting its German partners in Europe. Mitterrand needed Kohl.
Despite being isolated, Thatcher showed the first cracks in her iron by refusing to back down from her case against German reunification. She wrote in her memoirs that her opposition to Bush and Kohl's plan for a single German state within NATO and the EU was her biggest failure in foreign policy. The reason she reached out to Gorbachev was because she knew the USA was opposed to her view, and, for reasons of deep principle, she could not accept the Americans' position.
From the perspective of broader history, the logic of her policy against German reunifucation may be somewhat vindicated—but not in terms of its practicality. Thatcher predicted a reunified Germany would become too powerful within the EU. This prediction has to an extent come true. In the beginning, reunification slowed down the economic growth of West Germany. It had to sacrifice to help the East catch up. More recently, though, the dominance of Germany in the Eurozone and EU governance has been evident. Although it has reflected Germany's economic and political achievements, it arguably has created some tensions in Europe. The politics of the EU might be more agreeable in 2018 if Germany were not quite so dominant.
Thatcher also raised the concern that the political naiveté of the people in the newly liberated East and inequalities between East and West might lead to a resurgence of nationalism and xenophobia in the German state. Now it is 2017, and the Alternative for Germany, which is a far-right German anti-immigrant movement, is drawing most of its support from voters in the East.
Thatcher may have been diplomatically ineffective in her response toward German reunification, but she was no fool. She understood that a united Germany had implications for the concept of an EU composed of strong nation-states. She hoped for a Europe of independent nations that cooperated through agreements to lower trade barriers as well as to promote peace and solve common problems (like global warming). This was not the direction things were headed in if Helmut Kohl had the most say. The Germans and French were proposing monetary union and new powers for Brussels. Thatcher believed that if Kohl achieved a united Germany, it would strengthen his hand in creating a single European currency and central bank, which would lay the groundwork for a federal union.

25,"A motor rifle division (Motostrelkovaya divisiya, Мотострелкковая дивизия in Russian) is roughly the equivalent of a mechanised infantry division in other armies, equipped with armoured personnel carriers (APCs), infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), and tanks.
A motor rifle division was one of the two standard types of division in Warsaw Pact armies, alongside tank divisions. Motor rifle divisions were the heavy combat formations used in defence or for deliberate breakthrough operations, while tank divisions were lighter and more mobile and used for exploitation and counter-attack.
NATO intelligence in 1987 reported that the Soviet army included 150 motor rifle divisions, 52 tank divisions, and 7 airborne divisions.
Typically, a motor rifle division had three infantry regiments and one tank regiment; in a tank division those proportions were reversed. A motor rifle division had 13,000 men, 287 tanks, 150 IFVs and 221 APCs; a tank division had 10,500 men, 341 tanks, and 232 IFVs. The motor rifle division also had slightly more artillery.
In the 1970s and 80s, the standard armoured personnel carrier for front-line units was the eight-wheeled BTR-70, a development of the BTR-60 used in the 1960s.
The Soviet Army introduced the infantry fighting vehicle in 1966 with the tracked BMP-1, armed with a 73mm smoothbore cannon and a rocket launcher. In 1980 the upgraded BMP-2 came into service. In a motor rifle division one of the three regiments would have these, while the other two had APCs; in a tank division the infantry all had IFVs as standard.
BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle
Under the Tsars, the Russian Imperial Army was mostly made up of infantry divisions (pekhota or pekhotniye lyudi, пехота or пехотные люди - from пеший or on ones legs) with a small number of elite 'rifle' divisions and brigades (strelkovaya divisiya, стрелковая дивизия - shooting division) that enjoyed higher status. This hierarchy caused resentment, and so when Trotsky organised the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (RKKA) in 1918, the decision was taken to designate all its infantry units as 'rifle' formations. In October 1918 the RKKA thus included eleven Rifle Divisions; a number that would be expanded to 49 by the end of the Civil War, and many hundreds during the Great Patriotic War.
A Soviet rifle division was thus equivalent to the infantry divisions of bourgeois capitalist running-dog armies.
In January 1940 the 1st Rifle Division (or '1st Moscow Proletariat Red Banner Rifle Division', to give it its full title) was mechanised and redesignated as a Motor Rifle division. As part of the 7th Mechanised Corps, it was the first unit to employ T-34 tanks in combat.
After the war, a programme of mechanising the other Red Army divisions was put in place. Finally in 1957, all remaining Rifle Divisions were renamed Motor Rifle Divisions.
Typical Warsaw Pact divisional organisation
A Soviet MRD was pretty comparable to a NATO mechanised division, with differences dictated by their doctrines. The Warsaw Pact armies generally held back support assets such as heavy artillery at the Corps, Army or even Front level, to give concentrated assistance to major breakthroughs. NATO tended to allocate such assets more widely, dispersing them around lower-level formations to give more responsive support in fast-moving combat situations.
Pact units thus tended to be smaller than their NATO equivalents, with perhaps only 60-70% of the combat potential on a division-by-division basis. (Though of course the Soviets had many more divisions than NATO.)
In addition, the Soviets had weaknesses in C³ due to their reliance on short-service conscript troops, who were poorly trained compared to long-service professionals in most NATO units. As a result, motor rifle units usually operated concentrated - typically in a column formation, reconnaissance elements in front, then a forward security element to pin the enemy while the main column manoeuvred around them - rather than dispersing or allowing sub-units to take the initiative. NATO doctrine attempted to compensate for numerical inferiority by training their troops to react faster and disrupt the more rigid planning cycle of Soviet units by 'getting inside their decision loop'.

28,"Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were driven by a complex interplay of ideological, political, and economic factors, which led to shifts between cautious cooperation and often bitter superpower rivalry over the years. The distinct differences in the political systems of the two countries often prevented them from reaching a mutual understanding on key policy issues and even, as in the case of the Cuban missile crisis, brought them to the brink of war.
The United States government was initially hostile to the Soviet leaders for taking Russia out of World War I and was opposed to a state ideologically based on communism. Although the United States embarked on a famine relief program in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and American businessmen established commercial ties there during the period of the New Economic Policy (1921–29), the two countries did not establish diplomatic relations until 1933. By that time, the totalitarian nature of Joseph Stalin's regime presented an insurmountable obstacle to friendly relations with the West. Although World War II brought the two countries into an alliance, based on the common aim of defeating Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union's aggressive, anti-democratic policy toward Eastern Europe had created tensions even before the war ended.

29,"Here are Five To-Do’s for young aspiring totalitarians from someone who has seen the Soviet collapse both from inside and outside:
Pick Communism for ideology and enforce it mercilessly. It will give you the universal appeal as a torchbearer for justice and equality. All who hate American Imperialism, liberalism, and market economy will gravitate toward you. They are everywhere, much more numerous than you may think.
Aim high, act quick. The world may be enough, but empire-building is a hugely expensive enterprise. Be sure to take on your next rich enemy and conquer them well before you run out of money.
Kill as many as it takes, but cover every trace. Execute all executioners, then the executioners’ executioners. Give regular amnesties to a few harmless survivors, and make them the thankful ambassadors for the magnanimity of people’s power.
The proletarian state has only three friends: the army, the secret police and military-industrial complex. These are the only ones that never turn their back on you. Cherish them, feed them, make everyone love them.
Give people reasons to be proud of you. Build huge monuments, win impossible victories, triumph at the Olympic games, turn around rivers, make great music, profound poems and awesome propaganda posters. Beat Hitler in his own game and make uniforms to remain legend for centuries.

30,"We all know how the communist world looked like in the 1960s. The Chinese and the Soviets were the two biggest communist parties in the world.
But not many people know who the third biggest was. The Indonesian Communist Party.
The US was able to eliminate this communist party by supporting one man.
Suharto, who ruled my country, Indonesia, from 1966 to 1998.
Let’s take a look at why it was “successful” for the US.
During the early 1960s, communists were very powerful in Indonesia. They were found at all levels of government, city mayors, regional governments, military officers, you name it. In fact, the Indonesian Communist Party was the biggest non-ruling communist party in the world, and as I said before, the third biggest after China’s and the Soviets’.
There were fears of the country turning communist in a few years. Especially looking at the geopolitical situation in South East Asia with the Vietnam war raging not far away.
Indonesian communists parading in the 1960s
It all changed when a coup occured in October 1965 against the ruling president, Sukarno. The coup failed, but what happened afterwards was the point.
Over the next few months, Suharto, who was a military general at the time, stole the initiative, took control of the military, and eliminated the Indonesian Communist Party, killing more than a million suspected communists in the process.
A suspected communist being rounded up in late 1965
By March 1966, Sukarno had been stripped off all effective power. All power was in Suharto’s hands. That was when he had himself elected as president.
Sukarno transferring his presidency to Suharto in 1966
There is strong evidence that the CIA, and by extension the US, was involved in aiding Suharto. The CIA was involved in helping Suharto spread anti-communist news. The US embassy was also supplying the Indonesian military with names of prominent communists to hunt.
Also in the 1970s, there was another communist troublemaker in the form Timor Leste. The US provided military aid as Suharto invaded and annexed Timor Leste.
So the US destroyed the third biggest communist party in the world, prevented the rise of communism in Indonesia, turned the country into a pro-western country, and eliminated another smaller communistic country, by just supporting Suharto.
That’s pretty “successful” in my opinion.

31,"Originally Answered: Why did the Soviet Union collapse, but not China, Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos and Venezuela?
Well let’s take a look shall we?
China: Embraced liberal market reforms under Deng Xiaoping and abandoned the economic policies of Maoism.
Cuba: In danger of collapsing but has found a way to an economic ‘limbo’ through the use of self-employment and slow economic reforms to counter the disruption stemming from the Venezuelan Crisis.
Vietnam: Embraced limited liberal market reforms in the 1980s and abandoned the archaic economic policies of Le Duan.
Cambodia: Actually collapsed.
North Korea: Resource rich and dependent to the point of weakness, economically, on China for essentials and the limited trade it engages in outside of weapons manufacturing.
Venezuela: Currently collapsing.
The common theme present in these situations and noticeably absent from the Soviet Union was the slow-but-sure introduction of more liberal economic policies that pushed away from the Communist dependent model of ‘planned economies’ and allowed for more organic economic growth.
North Korea is the outlier here as it has formed a parasitic relationship with China that essentially amounts to ‘You keep the United States from our border, well give you the resources needed to maintain the bare minimum of existence as a national state.’ It is not an organic economy and is distressingly overreliant on its mineral resources and arms manufacturing to sustain its continuously deteriorating economic situation.
The Soviet Union collapsed because it failed to recognize the necessity for more flexible markets than the strict planned economies that are a pillar of Communist government only to institute reform too late and too recklessly for it to amount to any good.
Communism’s greatest and weakest point has always been its reliance on state-planned economies: they’re good for short-term results but terrible in the long-term if they are allowed to remain unchanged.

32,"The US was ahead in some areas, the Soviet were ahead in others.
The US DOD actually asked them selves this question in 1981 aswell.
The americans projected that based on their current knowledge of Soviet technology they had a unquestionable lead in 23 scientific areas. And the US had a lead in 18 areas. They estimated some additional areas which were shaky.
But you should keep in mind that this is before that the reality of things like the T-64 T-72 and T-80 tanks were known, it was before modern planes like the MiG-29 was introduced. You can find a lot of technology estimations and assements on Freedom of Information Act Electronic Reading Room by searching for the Soviet Union and Technology.
From my own research in the same libraries i will try to give you my opinion as objectively as I can.
Navy:
From about the 1960s Soviet Naval technology suppassed the american one. Another person answering this question speaks of aircraft carriers, but those were not technological innovations in the cold war. They were old world war 2 technology, as a matter of fact most of the US carriers in the cold war were Essex-class aircraft carrier from 1942. Only a few os the US carriers were supercarriers or nuclear carriers if you will. The Soviets on the other hand invested in long range missile technology. Nearly all Soviet ships were able to fire long range antiship missiles at enemy fleets. The first US anti ship missile was made in 1980 and is still in use today, Harpoon (missile). It is a very subpar missile not even close to the effectiveness of the soviet ones. It’s subsonic and not very big, while missiles like the P-270 Moskit moves at the 3 times the speed of sound and is enough to sink normal aircraft carrier.
The soviet union produced more than 500 vessels from my count that could fire cruise missiles. My comparison the US had less than 30 by the end of the cold war, and the threat of aircraft is highly exagerated due to Soviet fleets always having very heavy AA particularly in the 1980s where the ship Kirov-class battlecruiser provided S-300 long range anti aircraft cover to the fleet.
Airforce:
In the cold war the technical advantages swifted. The F-86 sabre was probably marginally better than the MiG-15 in the korean war. The MiG-17 then outperformed the sabre, the F-4 phantom was a solid plane unpar with the MiG-21 and better in some roles. In the 1970s the USA field very solid aircraft like the F-15 and the F-14 however not in great numbers, while the Soviet Union sported the MiG-23 which while not as good of a dog fighter was a very deadly missile platform with a good radar.
The Soviets made the MiG-25 the world’s fastest armed plane, even to this date. max speed 3.2 mach and 2.8 mach intercept speed with full combat load. The F-15 can fly at mach 2.5 when on low fuel and empty loadout for comparison.
For bombers the USA had the B-52 which was a better bomber than the Tu-95. However the US never managed to upgrade it’s bomber fleet during the cold war. While the Soviet Union made more than 800 supersonic bombers the US can to this day only sport 103 supersonic bombers of the B1 lancer type.
Again the Soviet Missile technology was exceptionally good in the late cold war. the R-73 (missile) archer was completely unmatched even after the cold war as an IR missile.
To give you an idea of how advanced the soviet missile technology was the IRIS-T missile that was adopted in 2005 is essentially a german made R-73 which was adopted in 1984. So the R-73 was 21 years ahead of it’s time so to speak.
The Soviet Union’s pilots in the 1980s also had the helmet mounted display, which is something US pilots didn’t get on the same level until early 2000s.
Luftwaffe MiG-29 experience - positives and negatives here you can read a comparison between a MiG-29B downgraded export version from 1984 vs the newest F-16s and F-18s.
Army:
There is so much here but I will try to keep it brief.
Infantry Weapons: Pretty much equal in most areas, the M16 is a good weapon, the AK-47 and 74 are good weapons too. The only real difference is in infantry equipment is the soviet RPG series. The US M72 LAW was pratically useless against later Soviet tanks and not very versatile at all. RPG-7 on the other hand was a very versatile weapon, later ammo for it could defeat any known NATO vehicle from the front except the M1A1 Abrams, which was later countered by the RPG-29.
Artillery: The US made a few attempts at large scale production of battlefield tactical missiles, but they were ineffective and not very widespread. The Soviets made many highly mobile systems, including the famous SCUD missile and later much more accurate ones including OTR-21 Tochka every soviet division had a tactical missile battery.
US never fielded proper MRL systems. The only one ever fielded was the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System but it never served the role of true suppression artillery. While the Soviets produced the BM-21 already in 1963, and had MLRs from ww2. The US went most of the cold war without any MRL system, and when they got one it wasn’t better than the already existing BM-27 Uragan and much rarer.
For basic artillery both sides had the same technology, with the Soviets having a much greater amount of self propelled artillery with the americans mostly having conventional towed artillery.
Armour:
The Soviets had a massive lead in armour technology from the 1960s and onwards. The first soviet Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot ammunition was made in early 1960s and put on the T-62.
The first US APFSDS is from 1979 nearly 20 years late. The T-64 sported composite armour as the first tank in the world in 1963 making it basically imune to HEAT ammo which was the standard AT ammo for NATO tanks until the 1980s.
The T-64B was able to fire anti tank missiles through it barrel, an idea they got from the US sheridan tank, but the US abandoned the idea, because they couldn’t make it work properly so no US tank has had them since then. The Israelis have the LAHAT missile for the 120mm gun though.
The Soviets also a pioneer of Reactive armour, Active protection system, Autoloader.
Futhermore the T-55 from 1961 and every tank made after it in the Soviet Union featured two plane gun stabilisation and CBRN defense, in the US the CBRN was first used on the M1A1 in 1985 and two plane gun stabilisation on the M60A1 AOS in the 1970s.
The US fielded the best computers and electronics, later also the first to use thermal optics. The US ammo was however much slower than Soviet, and the americans didn’t consider soviet lack of firing computers a problem, due to how fast their projectiles moved.
As for the quality of soviet tanks, this is what the US had to say about some of the things i described.

33,"First, China has it’s own culture, thousands of years old. That’s quite different from Russia. China was alredy old when Novgorod and Kiev were built, when Vladmir became ortodox. The chinese has it’s own failure modes, the dynastic collapses. They happen when the government loses the Mandate of Heaven - when it no longer takes care of the people, of the land and of heaven.
The CCP takes care of the people - the chinese are happy and fat, hundreds of millions of chinese left abject poverty and became middle class, surpassing many western countries like mine (Brazil) and even some european countries like Spain. If they keep it up they will be like the germans in a generation or two. But if corruption spreads, if unfairness and opression, hunger and disorder spreads, they will fail to take care of the people. I see no way for this to happen.
The CCP takes care of the land. China’s infrastructure is magnificent. Waterworks, railroads, electricity… but there is a lot of pollution there, damaging the fertile lands and the rivers. If the damage keeps growing and the CCP fail to keep the infrastructure healthy, if earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or nuclear meltdowns devastate the country, they will fail to take care of the land. The party takes care of the infrastructure very well and it’s response to disasters is fine, considering that the country has huge demographic densities. The death toll and the damages are small (compare with recent hurricanes in the US).
It’s on religious matters that the CCP fail due to the communist materialism. The weak religious devotion is dangerous because it reduces the morality and ethics of the people, bringing the threat of corruption. But for now, the CCP has been able to function even as an atheist organization. That’s the weak link, but it takes time for this weakness to threaten the other two pillars and reforms can be enacted to deal with it.
The Mandate is fine, for now. China won’t collapse. Not in this decade nor in the next at least.

35,"Not on the verge, but Russia is increasingly walking in the footsteps of the Soviet Union in its last decade. This is hard not to notice, except that those in Russia may view this positively.
The reliance of the political elites and the population on a single leader is striking. There are more than one party in Russia, but the ruling party still dominates others by far.
The reliance of Russia's finances on exports of raw materials is striking. Russia is now exporting rather than importing grains, but oil, gas and metals (primarily oil) still dominate exports and the revenues of the federal budget.
Russia's ongoing military buildup reminds very much the oil-funded Soviet buildup of the late 1970s. The military is now smaller as a fraction of the population, there are very few foreign bases (and few allies), and the Navy is a shadow of the Soviet Navy. But the September 2018 wargames Vostok-2018 with 300K servicemen are officially advertised as the largest since 1981.
Should Russia get into a serious military standoff with NATO to the point that this affects the world economy's growth prospects, world oil prices would go south and undermine Russia's federal budget for several years. Vice versa, if Russia and Iran manage to stir up local instability around the Persian Gulf, oil prices would go up and Russia would reap windfall profits. So, the economic circumstances can go both ways, but will most likely stay where they are, while the rest of the world develops at a faster rate.
Ethnically, Russia is obviously more homogeneous and stable than the USSR. However, Russia is entering a period of population decline, which may affect the engineering base and the economic growth. In particular, Russia's civilian space program (both rockets and satellites) is a slow train wreck. Russia never gained strength in digital electronics and has no capital to develop decent semiconductor fabrication for it. Even at the Olympics, Russia is losing its past high standing.
A smaller economy is showing in the military modernization efforts, which were given top priority. Naval shipbuilding is mostly limited to frigates and the repair of older capital ships. Transport/cargo and passenger aviation are in decline. The fifth-gen fighter program is a failure, and the new tank is too expensive for mass production. The nuclear program is shrouded in secrecy, but the SS-18 missiles designed and manufactured in Ukraine are now end-of-lifed while their replacement is not yet deployed. As of 2018, Putin is bragging about fantasy weapons, of which some never worked and repeatedly crashed in tests.
In the meantime, Russia's immediate neighbors to the West are busy reducing trade with Russia and increasing trade with the EU. Ukraine used to be a top-3 trade partner, but banned direct flights to/from Russia and overflights by Russian planes years ago, is now thinking of severing rail links. Tell me this does not echo the Iron Curtain. Yes, China is still trading with Russia, but their trade didn't grow after 2014 as was hoped for. India is still buying weapons from Russia, but pulled out from the Su-57 project and is buying from NATO countries instead.
The US has just imposed a new round of economic sanctions which limit investment in Russia. It's not actually clear what Russia is betting on - their world is shrinking, and everyone else is adapting to every trick they come up with, like propaganda and elections meddling.

36,"Not because of the reforms. The system was already running out of steam when he took over. Gorbachev was tasked with salvaging it, but failed.
The course of actions was like that:
1984: “Sh1t! The Americans are soon far ahead of us in military technologies, we gotta do something to catch up”
1985: “Eureka! Let’s splurge up on the best industrial equipment and speed up like Stalin did in the 1930s.”
1986: “We’re running out of money! When are these bloody oil prices gonna go back up?”
1987: “Wait! Why is all this new equipment staying idle and where are all the workers who are supposed to work on it?”
1988: “Why are none of our party comrades doing what they are ordered to do? Let’s let them know the ugly truth about themselves! And let people earn some extra money on their own if they know how!”
1989: “Why is the till empty? Why are all these nationalists acting up all of a sudden? Let’s print more money! Why are everyone stealing instead of working? Why is everyone criticizing us, and not Stalin or Brezhnev?”
1990: “Where’s all the food gone? Why is nobody working? Let’s print more money! Hey Americans, can you lend us some?”
1991: “Hey, everyone, let’s sit down and talk. People? Anyone?”
In other words, in 1985–1989 Gorbachev tried Stalin’s industrialization recipe, but without Stalin’s reign of terror. He also didn’t have the abundant workforce pool willing to work long days just for food, as in the 1930s.
When the measures didn’t work, he was increasingly abandoned by ethnic elites—starting with the 1986 unrest in Kazakhstan—and later by the state and party bureaucracy. Old-timers abandoned him because his reforms threatened their control over the economy. More advanced people in the party and government conscienciously worked to defeat the system because they eyed the chance to appropriate the state assets for themselves.
By the summer of 1991, Gorbachev virtually stood alone. With the failed coup of hard-liners, the game was over.

37,"Nearly Impossible
People in the PRC are mostly Han Chinese. The majority of almost all province are Han Chinese. Even in many provinces besides China proper, the majority are still Han Chinese. Therefore, Han Chinese are everywhere. It’s difficult for any minority to successfully secede from China.
Northern Han Chinese also view Southern Han Chinese as the same group of people as themselves. Southern Han Chinese also view Northern Han Chinese as the same. There is no segregation at all.
Han Chinese culture of unity is one of the strongest in the world for more than a thousand of years. You can see that China fragmented, and unified many times throughout history, while other empires just fragmented and simply gone forever.
Even though the PRC may not last for next 1,000–2,000 years, I believe China will still remain firm and united.

40,"Certainly.
Brazil, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa all have major military installations that could potentially be used by the US/NATO or whatever power bloc that opposes them in the wake of the devastation of the Northern Hemisphere. There are also multiple large cities in the Southern Hemisphere which possess significant manufacturing and technical capabilities which could be used to assist in the rebuilding processes of heavily damaged Northern combatants.
Unfortunately, any nuclear conflict so large that it would make targeting more than few Southern Hemisphere locations (If any at all) a erious consideration, would be so destructive that it would endanger those areas anyway without the need to use weapons. After all, today's population is only possible due to a complex logistical system which requires that good and services be transferred from North to South and vice versa. Radioactive fallout, the spread of disease due to mass deaths and the inability to get food and medication to remote áreas of the world be just as effective at destroying nations as nuclear strikes, if not more so.

41,"Quite poor. Ranks filled with highly unmotivated conscripts.
(Typical conscript. As hair cutting was not done in the Army, boys really let themselves go. I found a photo of my dad during his basic training, he looked like an early band member of ZZ-Top)
I have no doubt that if the Russians ever were to cross the Iron Curtain, the Dutch would’ve performed just as well, as they did against the Germans, the Japanese and the Serbs.
But…. We had inundation!
Inun-what? The theory that if you flood the land below sea-level, the enemy would be hindered just enough to ferry the Royal Family to England. This worked well against… Not the Germans. The Germans came with this brand-new innovation called “paratroopers”. But nonetheless, scientists got to work, and calculated that if we drowned the land until somewhere between 1m and 1.5m water, tanks would find it difficult to cross. (that was the theory)
(Inundation phase 1. Drown the land to create a watery border)
Around my town, they have a lot of stuff left from that era. They constructed large floating locks that could block the major rivers. They scattered small bunkers and casemates here and there.
(Yes, that’s the turret of a surplus Sherman tank.. Actually, the rest of the tank sits under ground, in a concrete base. A cheap casemate to protect this street.)
(Drawing of one of the floating locks)
Slight note 1: Most of the workings and works surrounding this IJssellinie was already leaked to the Russian intelligence in an early stage. A birdwatcher sent photos of the construction to a fellow birdwatcher in Russia “Look at those strange things they’re building near my birdwatching spot”. Rumors have it that the Russian intelligence constructed a copy of a waterpumping windmill on a secret location, to train engineers to operate these, as the only way to pump the inundated areas was using these mills we’ve preserved for this very reason (the regular diesel and electric pumps would be destroyed).
Just in case 10km of water didn’t stop the Russians, they could blow some more dykes until they flooded most of the country.
Slight note 2: During the Cuba crisis, several locks were closed to start raising the water level in the IJsselmeer lake in anticipation of WWIII. Cities around the lake complained that their sewage was coming back up the toilets.
Now, if the Russians really were to advance to The Netherlands, where would the army be placed, you wonder? The answer is: in Germany. The Dutch had a lot of bases in Germany, and knowing the motivation (or lack thereof) of Dutch conscripts and earlier attempts to stop advancing Germans and Japanese, the Dutch strategic planners took no risk and drew a ‘no step back plan’. Quite literally, as the army would be with their backs against the water.
Should the army be overrun (which was also likely) and the Russians would’ve found a way to cross the water, stashes of weapons were hidden in various locations to be handed out to veterans, reserve soldiers and Moluccans who would take up a guerilla.
Slight note 3: Those hidden arms stashes were part of a larger project Gladio. We’ve hidden them so well, that we kinda forgot where they all are. We just hope nobody bad finds them first.
Slight note 4: There was a joke among the intelligence community of that day. “One Russian general is talking to another general. ‘Shall we take Belgium or The Netherlands? They’re both equally weak.’ ‘Let’s take Belgium, the Belgians have chocolate and beer. The Dutch have cannibals (referring to Moluccans, armed to the teeth among the population) and water.’”

42,"Because China is cheating at communism.
China has a communist rule, communist-style suppression of media, suppression of protests, uses its army on its own people in protection of The Party, etc.
However, China also embraced capitalism, and has done rather well with it. They've opened their markets up to the world, manufacture goods that essentially everyone in the world buys now, and has created economic incentive for foreign investment, and as of recently, has even made Chinese bonds available for purchase to foreigners. China has also began to take up the mantle of “leading the world” regarding things such as clean energy.
The Soviet Union did none of that. They were closed off to the world, and fostered an extreme “us vs them” culture. The Soviets felt they were the superior nation in all fields, and any outside view to them was crushed rather swiftly.
Also, unlike the USSR, the PRC government seems to be listening to its country’s people way more than the Soviet Union did. Therefore, China has modernized (because that's what the people want), it’s opened up to the world (because the people want to be friendly with the world), and it has created an environment that is stable and where the people aren't starving and hating their government because they feel it has turned its back on them.
The Chinese government loves stability because that creates less of a reason for the civilians to protests, uprises, or a civil war to occur. All of those things mixed with instability typically initiates the beginning of the eventual death of communist or dictatorial states (I’m not saying that dictatorships and communist governments are similar or the same, I'm just saying that if you look at history, they both collapse quicker than democracies if instability ensues). The Chinese Communist Party wants to remain in power and has been able to understand history enough to know what kills communist states.
A lot of Chinese citizens I've talked to don't feel scared in China, and don't worry that Chinese secret police are going to come and kidnap them and make their family disappear. That was not the case at all in the USSR. No one seems to be worried in China, and it seems (to me at least) that the Chinese are content with their country. Aside from some protests happening in Hong Kong, I have yet to read about any recent Hungarian Uprising or Warsaw Uprising-esque protests happening in China (there's a very good chance I'm totally ill-informed on this however and if I am I'd like to be corrected).
I've seen many answers from Chinese citizens on Quora and they all have a very humble (while proud) self-image of themselves and their country. They look at the US economy and want to be like that. They look at Germany’s public education systems and strive to achieve that. They see that dealing with as many countries as possible in as many markets as possible will greatly benefit them, as well as the rest of the world.
China sees strong features in other countries and therefore wants to have those features too. They are able to look at themselves as a country and go “hey, country x is doing better at y than we are, we should study that and try to implement it”.
The USSR hated countries that did things that were even remotely different than how it did things. That's why it failed. The world changed around it, and it decided to remain stuck in its old ways. After enough time, it imploded on itself.
China has figured out how to implement the perfect hybrid of two completely opposite ideologies (at least it seems that way so far).

43,"In almost endless ways, we are still dealing with the aftershocks now.

Here are just some of the ways in which the collapse of the USSR affected the world. I am sure others can think of other ways:

A new wave of democracy as old Communist regimes collapsed in Eastern Europe, in particular, and as the US abandoned its support for authoritarian right-wing regimes in Latin America, especially, as the country no longer felt the need to put stopping the USSR ahead of democracy and human rights.
A new focus on democracy and human rights as an outcome of foreign policy, rather than an attempt at containing the Soviets, no matter the cost
The end of wars in places like Angola, where the two sides were essentially proxies for the two superpowers
The US becoming the sole superpower and the creation of a unipolar world (though we are now, arguably, seeing the rise of additional poles)
Independence for ex-Soviet republics such as the Baltic states, Ukraine and the Central Asian Republics such as Kazakhstan
The collapse of the Russian economy, mass-poverty, the rise of gangster capitalism, leading to cynicism of democracy and capitalism, and the eventual rise of Vladimir Putin
An existential crisis for the political left as liberal capitalism appeared to have won, throwing the credibility of statist solutions into doubt. Communist parties were most effected, often becoming much more moderate parties, or collapsing, but more moderate left-of-centre parties also rapidly moved to the centre and embraced a more capitalistic view.
The Gulf War (which would have never happened in the previous bipolar set-up as the USSR would have blocked it)
The reunification of Germany
The disintegration of Yugoslavia and the resultant Balkan wars
The mujahideen of Afghanistan (including Osama bin Laden) refocusing their hatred upon the 'decadent' West, rather than the Soviets who they had originally fought
The acceleration of China's opening up of its economy
The opening up of India's economy
The spread of international capitalism to Eastern Europe and throughout Asia, creating new markets
The expansion of the European Union from 12 member states to 28 member states
The deepening of European integration with the Maastricht Treaty which transitioned the European Economic Community into becoming the European Union.

That is just what I could think of in a 5 minute brainstorm, I am sure others can think of many more.

The world has changed almost unimaginably. For me, personally, there is a very clear impact. I sit, right now, on my bed, with my girlfriend lying next to me. I am British, she is Romanian. Had we been born twenty years earlier than we were then we would have been born on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain. It is highly unlikely that either of us would be able to visit the other's country. Romania was incredibly closed even by Eastern European standards, only friends of the regime were generally allowed to go outside it and my girlfriend's family were low-level political dissidents.

Instead, my other half finished university and was then able to win a scholarship at the London School of Economics. The cost of her degree and her ability to emigrate were aided by Romania's joining the EU in 2007. This allowed us to meet and begin our relationship two years ago.

Had Ceaucescu's dictatorship continued in Romania then she would have not been able to leave the country. In fact she may not have even survived. She was born two months before the communist dictatorship collapsed. When she was born, there were no goods on the shelves and thousands were starving. Her mother contracted a virus which made her unable to breastfeed. She needed baby formula. But there was no baby formula available in the shops because of the dire economic situation. Her mother was only able to feed her because a neighbour of theirs, who they believe was working for the Securitate, the Romanian secret police, was able to get them formula on the black market.

If you look at Romanians born in the 1980s, like my partner, and Romanians born in the 1990s you can see the visible difference in height, with the latter much taller as their generation was not malnourished.

The end of the Soviet Union resulted in massive, convulsive world changes, but perhaps the biggest change is for the literally billions of people who've seen their life chances rapidly improve.
