What I see in a lot of these discussions is a sort of fusion of techno-utopianism with dingbat libertarianism (hey, I’m being honest). I’m open to being convinced otherwise, and have actually gone to several conferences. But I still don’t see it.

1,"In order to get to Master level in blockchain development, you actually only need 3 months. This would put you in the top 1000 blockchain developers woldwide.
Here is how you can do it. I also put the time behind how long each point will probably take
Setting up a node on a blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Nano (1-2 days each)
Understanding what a consensus algorithm is. Here I listed the 14 most used consensus algorithms these days. Current consensus algorithms (1–2 days)
Forking an existing blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum (3–5 days)
Changing the consensus algorithm in your fork (1 week)
Setting up a testnet for that fork and putting it online (1-2 months)
Once, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.
Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.
Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.
If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 things
Writing a smart contract and putting it online on a decent platform such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (3–5 days)
Writing a dapp and putting it online on a decent smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (2–4 weeks)
Then you are among only 200 developers worldwide probably and very in demand.
Conclusion
So, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.
I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.
The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.
There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.
Some good ones are
Whitecodelabs in California
NetObjex Inc. in California
Daglet in Germany
Brainbot in Germany
iKantam in Minsk
They all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.

2,"Blockchain technology is Mostly Useless™.
It’s pretty much nothing more than a distributed permanent ledger system for recording transactions.
That’s it.
It solves the same problem that having a trusted broker, like Amazon, or E*Trade, or PayPal, or Visa, or a title company, certify a transaction on your behalf solves.
And fails to solve a lot of other things brokers actually solve, as well.
In any security system, there are three components.
These are:
Authentication — I am who I say I am
Authorization — who I say I am is allowed to do the thing I’m saying I want to do
Nonrepudiation — The person who requested this action actually requested it, and we’re sure it was them, and not someone pretending to be them
The part a permanent ledger solves is nonrepudiation.
Or to put it in terms a 5-year-old could understand: “no backsies”.
So what problem can Blockchain solve that a permanent ledger held by a trusted broker cannot solve?
It can let you distribute the permanent ledger all over hell and gone, without having to resort to a trusted broker.
You can even keep your own copy, if you want.
And because of the cryptographic signatures, I can’t claim that I did not, in fact order and pay for that inflatable sheep from The Inflate-A-Date Corporation of Trenton, New Jersey.
You could do the same thing, with a broker like Amazon.
But now you don’t need Amazon to do it.
So what problems can’t Blockchain solve, that everyone mistakenly believes it can?
Great question, and one which no one asks, which is why I’m glad I’m pretending you’ve asked it.
Blockchain does not render transactions anonymous.
If anything, it’s a lot more like hiring the graffiti artist Banksy to write:
Bob Bobertson bought an inflatable sheep from The Inflate-A-Date Corporation of Trenton, New Jersey, and now he can’t claim it never happened
on 10,000 walls, distributed all over the planet.
And now, because everyone loves Banksy’s work, third parties are copying that same graffiti to new walls, all the time.
Live a millennium, spend every waking hour scrubbing walls: that’s never going away.
OK; so what does the Blockchain property “distributed all over hell and gone” potentially enable?
I’m glad you asked that, too; you know, you ask really good questions, for a figment of my imagination!
It lets you disintermediate transactions.
In theory, this is rather powerful. You gain some things, you lose others.
What you gain:
You get rid of the Amazon brokerage fee
You get rid of the single chokepoint for sales tax; if the government wants their sales tax, they have to prove a transaction took place (or you can give it to them voluntarily)
All of the middlemen? Gone!
What you lose:
Transaction escrow — all payments are up front: hope you trust the person you are buying from, with no broker to vouch for them
Dispute resolution — someone sends you an empty box? Too bad you don’t have a broker you can go to to penalize them for being a bad actor
Schelling points — where do I go to buy that widget again? I know “Amazon”; how do I find “some widget seller somewhere”?
And if you don’t think those things all sound like disadvantages… welcome to the “Global Craig’s List”, only you never get to meet the guy on the other end of the transaction, and you send them cash, up front.
Count me in on this “Global Craig’s List” thing; I’m an idiot; where do I download the software?
You don’t.
Writing it would be massively complicated, since you essentially have a tiny piece of technology that you could use as part of the implementation of the software.
What you don’t have is a trading platform built on the technology, and then you don’t have software which runs on top of that platform as a server (doing selling) or a client (doing buying).
And that’s all before you do any catalog management and display, or anything else.
You are talking about needing another (literally, and quite conservatively) 30,000 times as much code as has already been written for just the blockchain itself.
But we haven’t even gotten to the best part yet!
The best part.
Say you’re a company that has a dream of providing this platform.
The whole thing, not just the teeny, tiny blockchain part.
You hire the best engineers; best at security, best at writing bug-free code, the best at everything.
And you get it done in half a decade or a decade.
It’s infrastructure.
All the real software engineers out there are currently laughing their asses off.
Because you never make any money from infrastructure. No one pays for it.
But maybe you're an idealistic “CTO” at a Blockchain startup, and you think people will buy your technology from you, because if you just spend a lot of effort building something, surely it will be worth a lot of money!
You’re wrong.
Let me ask you one question, oh hypothetical CTO…
When was the last time you bought a TCP/IP stack?
Note: This question has been sitting out there for a while; Amith Prabhu’s recent answer prompted me to answer as well. I’m pretty sure my answer is both more fun, and addresses the “utility” issue in a more profound way.

8,"Originally Answered: Susan Athey: What is the state of bitcoin and blockchain technology as of early 2016?
I have been working on many aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain technology for several years now.  I am on the board of Ripple, which uses blockchain-like technology for a variety of purposes, most notably helping financial institutions achieve instant settlement in cross-border payments. 
First, a tiny bit of background for the uninitiated (experts can skip below for my thoughts): today we don’t really have a solid foundation on which to build modern, digital financial services. 4% of wires fail; it can cost $40 to send $40; even banks have to wait days for international transfers; and a large share of money remitted home by the world’s poorest goes to transaction fees. Most of the world’s infrastructure is decades old; old, analog processes have been digitized but not rebuilt in entirely new ways.  As to what Bitcoin is, I have a YouTube video giving my version of an introduction to Bitcoin at
; the The Voice for Bitcoin & Blockchain Policy • Coin Center website (disclosure: I’m on the board) also has some excellent primers, and I also did an interview on Forbes awhile ago Susan Athey On How Digital Currency Could Transform Our Lives .  At a high level, Bitcoin is a technology that allows value to be moved as easily as information; a Bitcoin is a purely digital asset, defined as an entry on a ledger.  An individual who has a ledger entry assigning them ownership together with the associated key can authorize a new ledger entry moving the ownership to someone else.  The ledger entries are not promises or IOUs; the ledger entry is the complete definition of ownership.  Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges, and market forces determine the price.  I presented a paper at this year’s American Economic Association meetings with a simple theory showing how demand for the use of Bitcoin, as a way to transfer value cheaply and efficiently, determines Bitcoin price; I also matched it up to empirical evidence.  Bitcoin is not a company; it is open source software maintained by a community of developers.  Many entrepreneurs have built businesses providing services around it (e.g. currency exchanges, payment systems) as well as extending the technology or building alternatives with different features.
There are so many things to say about the state of Bitcoin that I can’t possibly do justice in a short answer, but here are a few thoughts.  First, 2014 was the year of excitement about consumer applications of Bitcoin, while 2015 saw huge interest from the financial sector incumbents in exploring the technology.  It will be interesting to see what happens in 2016!
At one level, the success of Bitcoin and related technologies is simply astounding.  Three years ago, institutions scoffed at the idea of decentralized solutions to storing items of value; instant settlement was predicted to be at least a decade off in the future; and the idea that a nation would move to entirely digital currency seemed like science fiction.  Bitcoin was a proof of concept that inspired the imaginations of engineers, entrepreneurs, and innovators all over the world; and it also served as a catalyst for an industry that had been resisting innovation as it was bogged down by and distracted by regulatory compliance and recovering from the financial crisis.  The industry went from saying “we’ll never all be able to coordinate on technological changes” to “if change is coming, I want to be a part of it.”  In my view, the importance of a catalyst for action cannot be understated, especially when dealing with large, conservative firms with disparate interests.  CEOs of major institutions are well-informed about blockchain technology, and a number of industry consortia have emerged to invest and explore it for a variety of use cases.
On the other hand, it has also become clear that we aren’t seeing very rapid adoption of Bitcoin as a currency and payment system for end consumers.  So it remains to be seen whether firms will end up finding use cases that scale.
One way to think about it all is like the beginning of the internet.  Early on there was a lot of discussion of protocols, packets, etc., but it took many years and many layers of services on top before it was useful.  And the first commercial uses had a lot of questionable elements (policy-makers in the 1990s were alarmed by the pornography and use of the internet for criminal activity). Bitcoin is in this earlier stage, before people have figured out what to do with a new technology.  If you think about all of the layers of the technology stack that Uber built on – smartphones, GPS, mapping technology, cloud computing services, innovations in marketplace business models and consumer familiarity with ratings systems, comfort with payment systems, etc.—we can understand why Uber only arrived decades after the internet was born.
So my prediction is that although we may not know yet exactly HOW things will change, we will see change in basic financial infrastructure so that money can move more easily, and we’ll all ultimately look to the popularization of Bitcoin as the catalyst that got the industry and governments and entrepreneurs moving quickly.   Ripple (where I’m on the board) has met a lot of success working with forward-thinking, major international financial institutions (e.g. Santander is a strategic investor) who want to use Ripple’s technology to streamline money movement.  At least one of the world’s leading central banks is working on (early stage) research about a government sponsored digital currency.  It is an exciting time for financial technology innovation!

9,"Originally Answered: Where is Ethereum going from here?
Because I notice most people aren't seeing the big picture with Ethereum on a protocol level, let's go over a few extremely important things coming in the near future.
I wrote a more detailed piece on Ethereum on my blog - What is an Ethereum Network? Guide about Ethereum and Ether.
Metropolis (Ethereum 3.0) -
This upgrade is planned for Aug/Sept and will be the first upgrade since Homestead (Ethereum 2.0). Metropolis will bring with it some huge upgrades.
Raiden - Currently Ethereum can process a maximum of 15 transactions per second whereas Bitcoin can do about 7.
This is way way behind what Visa does at 40k/tx per second.
You might have heard of Bitcoins lightening network which will equip Bitcoin to do infinite tx/sec? Well Raiden does the exact same thing on Ethereum by creating what are called ""Payment Channels"".
Without going into much detail, here is an example for it:
It's like Bob and Andrea agree to put a $100 deposit into an account and write notes saying one or the other owes $xy amount.
Then on a predefined day, one of them squares up the account by making one large transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.
ZN-Snarks - You know how some people in crypto communites tell you Ethereum isn't anonymous like Monero or ZCash?
Well, ZK-Snarks will make it possible for you to selectively make transactions public or private.
It's the same standard used for ZCash but applied on the protocol level on top of Ethereum. This is a huge part of Enterprise Ethereum Alliances road map which is why JP Morgan is working with ZCash to implement it into Quorum (it is a private Ethereum Chain of JPMorgan) as well.
Ethereum is essentially taking all the best features from other coins and implementing them on their blockchain.
Ice Age - Currently, there are approx 93 Million ETH circulating with 5 Ethers created every 15 seconds (15% annual inflation).
The last upgrade (Frontier) had an ""Ice Age"" coded into Ethereum which will slow down the creation of ETH on a curve that would eventually freeze up Ethereum.
The motive for this was to force the developers to finish up Metropolis before the network froze up.
A side effect of this feature is that the creation of ETH slows down thus reducing the rate of inflation but also increasing the transaction time. We're beginning to see the first effects of ice age and by August it'll be 5 ETH created every ~30 seconds.
Casper - In short after Metropolis, EEA will come out with the actual figures for Casper as well as the first of 5 phases which will move Ethereum from PoW (Proof of Work) using mining rigs and computers to approve transactions to PoS (Proof of Stake).
With PoS, instead of miners running all the time, you will have people holding ETH ""Stake"" their ETH and basically lock their ETH up in a smart contract while running software on their internet connected computer.
As a reward for locking their ETH up, they will earn interest on it at an undermined rate (Vitalik has floated figures around 6-12% annually). Not everyone will be able to stake, Vitalik has said that the inflation rate of ETH will go down from 15% currently to 0-2% after Casper and PoS implementation.
Do some basic supply and demand math and you should be able to figure out what that means for the price.
This last update, Casper, is a major reason people are holding on ETH.
Just think of it: if in 1 year you could lock up 1000 ETH and earn 120 ETH per year? If the price is $500/ETH you're talking USD $60k annual without selling any of your original ETH.

10,"It actually can, because it's an agent-centric and not a data-centric network like the usual blockchain, so it's near infinitely scalable and decentralized, because each agent is independent and can process lots of transactions by themselves.
Compared to the other very promising “non-blockchain blockchains” without a limit on possible TPS: IOTA, Hashgraph, and Radix, it can definitely keep up.
However, Holochain will only go fully live in January or February probably. Until then, there can not be too much price action, so Holochain will possibly miss the coming bull run and be one of the average performers.
This would be good and healthy, because crypto investors don't throw their money at pre-launch networks anymore.

13,"The best applications of the blockchain are in industries that are controlled by very large and corrupt institutions that make the industry very inefficient.
Most of them are also already used by companies and individuals in the real world.
This list is sorted by potential from greatest to lesser.
The healthcare industry is one of the largest industries, but extremely inefficient with no standards. I think the blockchain could do a lot of good here. This system is easy to standardize and decentralize. Blockchain technology would help save lives and cut the rising cost of healthcare. (Medishares, Mediblocks).
A completely decentralized internet, where ISPs aren’t needed anymore. This is what Skycoin does with Skywire. They will soon provide their custom built 1Gbps antennas for $100, which have a range of 10 miles and provide high speed internet to 7,000 people and with their mesh network on top probably 20,000 people. You only need 2,000 antennas per European country to cover the whole continent and the data is stored on Skyminers.
Real Estate. Similar to the Entertainment industry, Real-Estate is very, very big, but also controlled by a few big players and it’s very much about who you know. This can also be democratized with the blockchain. (IHT Real, Bitrent, Relex)
Pension Funds. This industry is probably the largest of all and is extremely opaque and this makes trillions of dollars disappear and land in the pockets of “facilitators” (Akropolis)
Energy. The energy is very large and very prone to cartel forming. This is where decentralized purchasing of electricity removes a lot of ineffiencies and prevents fraud. (WePower, PowerLedger, Electrify.Asia)
Lending. There is not much lending in crypto yet at all, though it can be one of the biggest markets, since lending is the whole raison d’etre for banks. (Salt, Ripio, Ethlend)
Security Identification, so that you don’t show your passport when traveling anymore, because security identification is now all handled by the block chain (Civic, THEKEY)
Decentralized Storage. This is directly competing with Google Drive and Dropbox for individuals but more importantly with all kinds of data servers, for example everything that runs on Amazon servers could be run decentralized, not in data centers, but distributed across millions of devices. There are a lot of competitors in this space, namely Siacoin, IOTA, Skycoin, Byteball, Storj, Maidsafecoin, Bluzelle.
Voting. Well, there is a lot of meddling and fake elections in many countries, so the blockchain can completely prevent that and would have a huge impact on everyone’s lives. (DistrictXo, Counterpart)
Entertainment. The entertainment industry is huge and controled by a few moguls (Weinstein). This can all be democratized and decentralized. (Tron, Theta, Singular)
Entertainment. The entertainment industry is huge and controled by a few moguls (Weinstein). This can all be democratized and decentralized. (Tron, Theta, Singular)
Social Networking. Currently, it is very hard for content creators to properly monetize their content. This is made much easier with the blockchain and more fairer without involvement from a centralized entitity like Facebook or Google that controls content (Steem, Reddcoin, Mithril)
Gaming. There is a lot of fraud in gaming. Not anymore with the blockchain. (Enj, Wax, Decentreland, Game, Ion, XP)
Adult. The adult industry is a paradise for scammers and malware. The blockchain can prevent that. Adult being one of the world’s largest industries and the most important vehicle to decide for new technologies (HD-DVD vs. Blue Ray), there is a lot of potential. (XPlay, SpankChain)
Gambling. The gambling industry is very scammy, similar to the adult industry. With standards and decentralized blockchains, this can all be prevented. (Fun, Edgeless, Casino coin, Wagerr)
Social Networking. There are several cryptocurrencies where content creators are rewarded with crypto and they offer a decentralized storage of data. Quite interesting (Steem, Rdd, Mithril)
Ticketing with the GET Protocol - A working ticketing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Has ticketed over 50,000 tickets in the Netherlands so far using its application GUTS Tickets, already has over 1Million Tickets lined up to be sold on the protocol by the end of next year. Famous artists and comedians like Zaz, Jochem Myjer, Guus Meeuwis & Youp Van 't Hek onboard, using the Ethereum mainnet in Q3 of this year.
So, this is my list of the most powerful blockchain applications ranked by powerfulness and usefulness.
Interestingly, the top 3 industries aren’t really served yet, only by smaller cryptocurrencies (Mediblocs, Medishares, District, Counterpart, Civic, THEKEY) that have not seen that much popularity yet. I think the reason for that is, because the industry are so huge and deeply controlled by the rich and powerful and very political that it will take a long time for cryptocurrencies to have an impact here, while it will probably go much faster in the ones ranked lower (Gaming, Adult, Gambling, Ticketing).
it looks like the Top 7 has the biggest potential, but will take the most time while the bottom 7 has a smaller market, but will make an impact much faster.
Some of these blockchain have already found usage and we can expect for some of them to become the standard worldwide in several industries.

16,"There’s a few ways to approach this.
First and foremost, to repeat what everyone else says, you have to do your own research before deciding where your money goes. Find a platform that gives you the information you need. I personally use Bitdec since it helps figure out what exchange to go to in addition to all the data about the coin itself.
You can always bet on Bitcoin. There’s a reason it’s called the gold of the crypto. It established itself as a value holder, so if your plan is to go into crypto long term, this could be a good way to go.
Now, when it comes to altcoins (all the other coins) there are two general groups - the ones that have already gained some momentum and the ones that are just being released. Year 2018 is definitely a year of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), and various blockchain based solutions and currencies are popping up left and right.
You can either jump on the ones that are clear to have gained attention and some success such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash etc. or go for those that are still in super early stage of development, where the price is still very low for a single token.
Having said all this, I would personally get some Bitcoin and some of the bigger altcoins while keeping my eye on the up and coming ones (mainly because so many ICOs have failed so far).
Once you get your first crypto assets and decide to diversify your portfolio, you should be using a service like this one to always make sure you’re getting the best rate when exchanging, simply because there are so many of them out there and it’s next to impossible to try and do it manually.

17,"Blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. It enables parties that don't trust each other to maintain a reliable record without needing a trusted third party. However, in most situations in the real world, there are several trusted third parties. We trust the New York Stock Exchange to settle our stock trades correctly, for example.
Cryptocurrency is a special case, because most currencies are controlled by a third party government that is very much not trusted, and currency-like commodities such as gold are impacted by real world events like changes in mining costs. Furthermore, laws make it difficult to move traditional currencies and commodities around the globe, to establish new currencies, and to transact anonymously. Cryptocurrency solves these problems.
All that said, I'm sure all of these companies do have small teams exploring possible applications of blockchain technology. They may even have products in development right now. But I kind of doubt it.
Edit: Two commenters pointed out that the first paragraph of this answer isn't true for many developing countries. Indeed, for these countries blockchain does solve real problems in facilitating the exchange of financial instruments. However, developed country tech firms won't be the ones to solve those problems for the same two reasons developed country finance firms haven't: laws and market size. In many developing countries, regulations make it explicitly or practically impossible to develop new exchanges. And even where those barriers don't exist, the amount of money that can be made is too small to justify the investment. So I suspect blockchain systems for developing countries will be built locally or by nonprofits.

18,"Before discussing the replacement for Ethereum, we should discuss the upgrades coming to the blockchain.
Ethereum is many things. A golden goose of 2017. An ICO enabler. A beautiful iteration on blockchain technology. It is indeed those things, and many more.
But first let's talk a moment about what Ethereum is not: scalable. Ethereum can now process about 20 transactions per second. As we all know, that's actually quite slow compared to Paypal (500/s+) and Visa (50,000/s+). Below, I'll discuss where we are today, and take you through to where we're going next.
Why is this important to you? Well, knowledge is power. And the knowledge is out there for the taking...
First, why is transaction speed important?
Well, because people, markets and digital cats are impatient -- and the deluge of ICOs means that Ethereum transaction volume is only set to increase. Remember, they all use the same blockchain network. As I have said before, running enterprise applications on 2018 Ethereum blockchain is like trying to play Call of Duty on a 28kbs modem from 1995.
At the time of this writing, about 7,000 transactions are backlogged on the Ethereum blockchain, and it's ballooned far higher than that in the past.
Why is Ethereum so slow?
Ethereum runs across a whole bunch 'nodes' sitting on servers around the world. Like Bitcoin, every node stores every transaction that was ever made on the entire blockchain. As of today, it looks like we're at 411 gigabytes for a full node.
And every transaction has to be cryptographically solved by every node on the network so that every computer has the entire chain. Rinse and repeat about a million times a day, and you can see why the highway can get clogged.
Today and Tomorrow
I've been a longtime follower of the Ethereum product roadmap and I can tell you that it's been a crazy ride.
For those who want to nail the specific details: we are currently on the Byzantium release of Ethereum, the first part of the Metropolis stage. Byzantium was released in October of 2017 and, in summary, did the following:
Upgrade 1: Set the stage for private transactions (though it did not implement them). Privacy is important, but does not really exist on the current Ethereum network.
Upgrade 2: Sped up the transactions by allowing them to solve problems in parallel (we'll get back to ""Sharding"" later)
Upgrade 3: Smart Contract improvements for developers. In short, it made it less expensive to cancel smart contracts once they start.
The second and final part of Metropolis will be Constantinople.
This release, currently without a specific timeline (though I have a rough guess, holler at me as I don't want to spread FUD) will introduce the stage for the Casper proof-of-stake upgrade.
To be technical, Constantinople won't actually turn Ethereum into a purely proof-of-stake mechanism (aka miners aren't going anywhere), but it will likely provide a secondary, hybrid verification system for transactions based on how many coins the miner holds, and is willing to ""stake"". A lot of staked coins means the staker will typically win more block rewards, but will lose the entire stake if they try to cheat the system and are caught.
This sets the stage for eventually going off of proof-of-work entirely (going full Casper!), and saving a small part of the environment from blockchain destruction.
Up Next
In a later answer, I will describe the next stages of the Ethereum product roadmap being planned. In my view, these upgrades are a race against time -- new Gen 3 blockchains are sprouting up like weeds, and have incorporated some really interesting features into their technology. Ethereum still controls a massive network, but it needs to get enterprise ready... and fast.

23,"Originally Answered: What are your thoughts about the Ethereum cryptocurrency?
Ethereum has the potential to be the #1 cryptocurrency.
Take a look at the following chart:
Ethereum Transaction Growth Chart
As you can see, the number of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has been increasing exponentially. Cryptocurrencies, like social networks, have extremely strong network effects and once adoption reaches critical mass, growth tends to accelerate exponentially, not linearly.
The mainstream public is just starting to become aware of Ethereum, but Ethereum already has the backing of major global corporations. The recently formed Enterprise Ethereum Alliance consists of giants such as Intel, J.P. Morgan, and Microsoft.
There are hundreds, possibly thousands of Ethereum projects in development. Many of these applications are focused on making Ethereum more accessible to the general public. The world wide web was extremely inaccessible in the early days until Netscape came along and made it much easier for the general public to browse the internet. As the experience of browsing the web became much more accessible, usage exploded. Ethereum hasn’t had its “Netscape” yet, but it is in development. As these projects come online over the next few years, millions of people will be introduced to Ethereum. As the number of users continue to grow, the utility and value of Ethereum will grow exponentially.
There will likely be some growing pains along the way, but Ethereum has a great development team. Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin is very well-respected and most people in the Ethereum community believe in his vision. Having a strong leader at this stage in development is extremely important because protocol upgrades can be much more easily implemented. Since Ethereum is a relatively new cryptocurrency, its developers have had the opportunity to learn from mistakes that Bitcoin and other earlier cryptocurrencies have made and have plans to preemptively solve them.
Here are some of the upgrades that are currently in development:
Scalability improvements - Raiden Network makes 1,000,000+ transfers per second possible. Ethereum can currently handle about 15 transactions per second, while Bitcoin is limited to around 7.
Anonymous transactions - Zk-SNARKs will dramatically improve privacy by enabling completely anonymous transactions.
The transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will prevent miner centralization, protect against 51% attacks, and decrease the inflation rate.
The Ethereum protocol is continuously evolving, there are myriad applications in development, and the user base is exploding. The future for Ethereum looks very bright.

24,"In order to learn blockchain development, here is how you can do it. You can learn almost everything about blockchain within only 2–3 months.
I also put the time behind how long each point will probably take:
Setting up a node on a blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA, Nano (1-2 days each)
Understanding what a consensus algorithm is. Here I listed the 14 most used consensus algorithms these days. Current consensus algorithms (1–2 days)
Reading all of my 400 answers. As a blockchain developer it’s not only enough to program blockchains, you also need to know which things to developer, because some things are bad (permissioned and trusted networks, mining pool centralization). Reading all of my answers, gives you a very good overview of all things that are important around the blockchain gives, namely decentralization, scalability, security, all kinds of attacks, marketability of a blockchain, different blockchain technologies, advantages and disadvantages of blockchain technologies over one another, evolution of blockchains (1st gen, 2nd gen, 3rd gen), bad blockchain design choices, fallacies in blockchain design, removing emotional bias in blockchain technologies. (1-2 days)
Forking an existing blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum (3–5 days)
Forking a wallet ( 3 days)
Changing the consensus algorithm in your fork (1 week)
Setting up a testnet for that fork and putting it online (1-2 months)
Once, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.
Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.
Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.
If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 things
Writing a smart contract and putting it online on a decent platform such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (3–5 days)
Writing a dapp and putting it online on a decent smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, Elastos or Aeternity (2–4 weeks)
Then you are probably among the most experienced 200 blockchain developers worldwide and very in demand.
Conclusion
So, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.
I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.
The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.
There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.
Some good ones are
Whitecodelabs in California
NetObjex Inc. in California
Advanced Blockchain in Germany
Brainbot in Germany
iKantam in Minsk
They all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.

26,"A Glimpse Into The Not-So-Distant Future Of Blockchain and IoT
When Bitcoin was first introduced to the general public in 2009 as the first decentralized digital currency, very few people took the idea seriously. “Who would ever use digital money instead of real money?” A single Bitcoin was worth just a few dollars.
Fast-forward to today, almost a decade later, and Bitcoin is all over the news. For the past six months, cryptocurrency advocates and investors have been on a rollercoaster ride, watching Bitcoin climb to a peak value of $4,450, simultaneously competing with its first true market threat, Ethereum.
What makes Ethereum such a threat to Bitcoin is its unique underlying Blockchain technology, not necessarily the fact that it’s just another digital currency. The model of Ethereum utilizes what are called Smart Contracts, essentially automating any sort of existing process in a trusted manner. What makes cryptocurrency as a whole so enticing is the fact that I can send you (or you can send me) money without needing a third-party mediator like a bank. Now, imagine being able to have that same sort of direct, trusted transaction with any product. That’s the value of Ethereum’s Smart Contract technology. You can program a set of rules in the form of if-then statements, where If certain qualifications are met, Then the next step is released, etc.
Except the difference is every contract is permanently and publicly recorded and cannot be tampered with, making it more trustworthy and reliable than any third-party mediator every could be.
Let’s look at a simple example: selling your car. Simple, right? Wrong. Selling your car is a hassle. First, you’ve got to find a buyer. Then you need to exchange money, transfer the title, record all of this through the DVM. What if the transaction could be directly linked with smart contracts on blockchain? Once payment is received, the title of the car is transferred from party A to party B. Imagine how easy it would be if your AutoTrader app had a built in blockchain system to track VINs and ownership, your Carfax record, titles, registration, past registrations?
This is what has me so excited about the future of Blockchain and the impact it will have on IoT—the Internet of Things. We’re still very much in the early stages of this disruptive new technology, but the use cases for it are seemingly unlimited. Product authentication, especially, is one of the areas I’m particularly interested in, since ownership of products can be tracked at every stage of their existence.
Let me give you another example.
Counterfeit wine is a big problem, with the largest counterfeit market existing in China. It’s estimated that approximately 70% of all “imported” wine in China is fake. How this happens is counterfeiters buy up old, empty bottles from renowned vineyards so that the wine passes a sample test from the bottle’s glass or label. The bottles are then filled with much cheaper alternatives and passed off as luxury goods—a 1958 Château Lafite Rothschild or a 1928 Château Margaux, for example.
Counterfeiting causes all sorts of problems for both brands and consumers. Fake wines that circulate the market cause consumers to lose confidence in purchasing certain brands, leading to revenue losses of approximately $2.7 billion per year, as of 2015.
This was a problem we actually tackled at my firm, Chronicled, knowing that the benefits of using Blockchain’s Smart Contracts technology could provide a viable solution. We thought, “Why not attach encrypted microchips to the wine bottles to create an unforgeable digital identity for each bottle?”
So that’s what we did.
We embedded microchips into the wine bottles that could not be copied, cloned, or corrupted. This way, collectors could easily verify the authenticity of a wine by scanning the microchip with their smartphone. For brands, this provided security against counterfeiting practices, and for consumers, they could instantly learn more about the history of any registered wine—such as the complete provenance, history of the product as a whole, notes and even the intentions of the winemaker.
The uses for Smart Contracts are never-ending. Another example is what’s happening in Germany, where they’re piloting a charging grid for electric vehicles built right into the asphalt. When your car stops, it charges for the amount of time it’s at the stoplight. And then the car itself, which has an identity on the Ethereum Blockchain, can issue a micro-payment to another device embedded in the asphalt. It’s this machine-to-machine interaction that is the big step toward a new future, especially when combined with the concept of having a cryptocurrency wallet functioning as the backbone for this machine economy.
Of course, it’s worth noting that with all the glorious improvements that come with technological advancement, there is also an element of moral hazard (if we can call it that). Take something as innocuous as your toothbrush, combined with product authentication connected to the Blockchain. We very well may see the day where the usage of your toothbrush could be stored as public data. An insurance company may see that you have been using your toothbrush less often this month, and slightly increase your dental premiums as a result.
I know this sounds far-fetched, but that’s how every technological advancement begins: it’s all theory, until it’s not.
The good news, and what keeps me optimistic about the future of Blockchain technology, is the fact that there is already a global discussion around data ownership, with steps being taken to put ownership back in the hands of the people. Using the toothbrush example, the future may very well involve consumers granting access to their personal data and teeth cleaning habits in exchange for an insurance premium discount. At least this way, the consent is the choice of the individual.
What’s important through this wave of new technological advancement is that more of the general public begins to educate themselves on what innovations are happening with Blockchain technology. Ten years ago, we thought the concept of Bitcoin was laughable. Bitcoin now has a market cap of about $41 billion.
The not-so-distant future of Blockchain is happening a lot faster than many realize.
And it’s only going to move faster from here.

29,"I am really bullish on IOTA. Why?
Because it is one of the ONLY 2 coins out of all the thousands of coins that can fulfil Kramer’s 6 Blockchain Criteria. I wrote about this here before in more detail.
Near infinite scalability
Near infinite decentralisation
Low energy usage
Near instant transactions
Permissionlessness and trustlessness
Zero Fees
I specifically asked if IOTA is truly near infinitely scalable on reddit and it is true. IOTA has no upper limit.
Most cryptocurrencies brag about being able to process 2,000 or 3,000transactions per second. This is laughable.
Many take VISA level performance as a benchmark. VISA usually processes around 3,000 TPS, up to 25,000 TPS during peak times and a maximum of 64,000 TPS. That means that this cryptocurrency would need to be able to perform at least several thousand TPS.
However, this is very naive. You cannot look at current technology to set a goal for its use. For example, just because 1 million facsimiles were sent per day in the year 1990, taking 1 million emails sent per day is a good benchmark for a new technology at all. Why?
Because today, 300 billion (!) emails are sent per day! That’s 300,000x more emails sent today than facscimiles back when email replaced facsimiles.
So, how much TPS should a good cryptocurrency be able to handle? Should it aim for VISA level of 3,000 TPS? No, it should aim for 3,000 * 300,000 = 900 million TPS.
With its Lightning network recently launched, Bitcoin is realistically looking at 50,000 possible soon. Other notable cryptocurrencies besides IOTA and Bitcoin are Nano with 7,000 TPS already tested, Neo, LISK and RHOC with 100,000 TPS by 2020, Ripple with 50,000 TPS.
So, all the cryptocurrency that brag about being able to process 2,000 TPS absolutely pale in comparison and have no claim to become a revolutionary technology currently. Even the ones that brag about being able to process 1 million TPS, they are not set for the future. Their scalability is 1,000x too small if they want to be the leader in the new era of blockchain technology.
This brings us to IOTA, which aims to connect all 80 billion IoT devices that are expected to exist by 2025, which constantly communicate with each other, creating 80 billion or more transactions per second. Currently, 8 billion devices are connected to the Internet.
In addition, we will have probably around 1 million dapps on our blockchain platforms with probably 5,000 users per day each, 50 billion users per day total, creating several billion transactions per second.
IOTA has the technology to process 80 or 800 billion transactions per second. Everyone else is only at 0.0001%-0.00001% of that capacity!
Conclusion
Does it become clear why I’m bullish on IOTA and why IOTA is simply 1,000x better than all other cryptocurrencies?
All that being said, there are still several hiccups with IOTA.
IOTA has not proven that it can actually scale to billions of TPS, but no one has been able to prove otherwise so far.
IOTA’s network is still slow, because it is small. However, that doesn’t matter, what matters is how it behaves at scale.
IOTA still has the coordinator, but the coordinator is simply not required at scale.
IOTA’s founders seem to be a bit young and emotional still, which can create problems, but I think they will also manage that.
Apart from IOTA, the only one that I can see being a match is Elastos with their side-chain architecture, which basically can create a new chain with several thousand TPS for every dapp, every company, every household.

31,"There are a few ways to rank cryptocurrencies, but the most used criterion is market capitalization. Bitcoin has a market cap of 151 billion dollars as of now. Here are the top three most popular altcoins:
Ethereum has a market cap of 85 billion dollars. Many would argue that this is the second most popular cryptocurrency out there. It is known for its feature called “smart contracts” which, put simply, allows people to set up things like ticket selling markets or crowdfunding projects where people would put in desired amount of ETH which is either used for the project when it reaches enough funds or is safely returned to the investor if that doesn’t happen in a certain amount of time.
Litecoin is currently capped at 8.9 billion USD. It was developed by a former Google engineer, Charlie Lee. It is sometimes referred to as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold”. In a sense, that sounds right since it is potentially the most similar to bitcoin in the way it operates. The main perk of this currency is the speed and ease with which transactions happen. Blocks are released much more frequently than bitcoin(every 2.5 minutes versus 10 minutes for BTC) which makes it more acceptable to merchants.
Ripple (42 billion dollars market cap) is an interesting one since it has somewhat of a different niche of users. It was adopted by large financial institutions which means it’s in use way more on daily basis giving it liquidity and stability. That proved to be the case especially while most of other coins were dropping (they tend to move in the same direction anyway) it was still pretty steady.
There are, of course, many many more, but the number of currencies is so high nowadays that it doesn’t even make sense to even try to get into all of them.
So, if you only have Bitcoin and looking to diversify your portfolio, make sure to look into all the options you can get on different platforms since the market is very unregulated. This is especially true since the previous year was all about altcoins and everyone started jumping on trading with different currencies.

33,"Blockchain is a very hot topic right now, and Blockchain developers are in high demand. So it makes sense for a developer to want to dive in and add Blockchain development capabilities in his/her repertoire.
What’s important to understand though, is that Blockchain has come a long way as a technology from the first paper published by Satoshi. Sure, it would be a good thing to start from that paper[1], but it might appear complicated and can be confusing.
Another important point is, Blockchain development is not concentrated to, and around, Bitcoins. You might be a Blockchain developer and still have never worked with Bitcoins. It is entirely possible.
I would try to explain in short, various concepts around which Blockchain development revolves. Then I would also provide a gist of technologies which can be used to become a Blockchain developer.
Concepts
Decentralization : No one entity should own all the assets or resources in the network. It is important to understand how this is different compared to a distributed network. A distributed network can still be owned by one entity, for instance Netflix. A distributed network is essential for a decentralized network, but it is not necessarily decentralized in it’s own right.
Immutability : The data once written, should always be a part of the network. Any change performed over the data must also be recorded in the network. This can be achieved by creating hash of each transaction/operation performed in the network and add it to the next transaction as a meta data. This chains every new transaction to it’s previous transaction and that is where Blockchain derives it’s name from.
Assets/Entities : The storage network should support storage of data or some form of transferable asset in some form or the other. This can be Bitcoins for Bitcoin network, or Ether[2] or Smart contracts or other forms of data in Ethereum [3]network or Assets in case of BigchainDB[4]. (All these are different kinds of prevalent Blockchain networks or frameworks and I will talk about them in some detail later)
Censor resistance : Although this point is inherent to Decentralization, some Blockchain enthusiasts make a point of mentioning it separately. Basically any single authority should not be able to Censor the flow of data or exchange of information over a Blockchain. But with the advent of private Blockchain technologies, Censor resistance is not a compulsory component of a Blockchain.
To sum this section up, Blockchain is any decentralized network which supports aforementioned characteristics.
Now that we have a basic broad explanation of Blockchain, we can move on to the topic of development.
When Bitcoin was launched, the underlying technology wasn’t much explored. But as the interest grew, experts started looking at the architecture which supported bitcoins. An analysis quickly revealed that this architecture had far reaching potential. To put it in simple words, Bitcoin is to Blockchain, what Email was to Internet. Sure it is one very important application of it, it is not the only possible application. And Blockchain is touted to be Internet 2.0 .
To explore such potential, a lot of new development technologies have come up. Let’s talk about some of them.
Ethereum : Ethereum is not only a Blockchain where one can trade in Ethers. It is also a development framework where one can realize a lot of wonderful ideas and implement them using a Blockchain. The most important aspect of Ethereum Blockchain Development is a concept called Smart Contracts. Smart contracts are basically simple methods or functions which run on the Ethereum Blockchain. They can be imagined as something similar to a Java function for instance. But the difference is that every time the Smart Contracts are executed, the execution takes place over the Blockchain and it is written forever in form of a transaction in it. The transaction can not be deleted.

A lot of Blockchain developers are developing Smart contracts. Smart contracts are written in Solidity[5]. According to the introduction, Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can learn the development of Solidity by following the tutorial and examples on the mentioned link.
BigchainDB : You might have guessed it by now, that Blockchain suffers from scalability problem. Storing large amount of data on Blockchain is not a great idea. This is the problem that BigchainDb tries to solve. It is another Blockchain related technology which when used stand alone, can provide a very fast (1 million transactions per second) throughput. It can be used as a Blockchain in it’s own right. But it can also be used in conjunction with Ethereum to act as a Blockchain secure database where Ethereum acts as the logic processing part of the stack. The development of BigchainDB can be done using nodeJS or a variety of other programming languages. The entire list can be found in the Driver and Tools section here[6]. A good starting point to start developing using BigchainDB can be found here[7].
Hyperledger : Hyperledger is a Business Blockchain tool developed by Linux foundation and IBM. It provides the capability to create a private permissioned Blockchain. A good point to start learning Blockchain development using Hyperledger would be this[8].
There are a few other technologies too, like IOTA, Lisk, Interledger but they can be handled later on a need to know basis.
My advice would be to stay away from generic explanations about Blockchain and start with one of these technologies and dive into development. Not that those explanations aren’t good, but they don’t serve a lot of purpose when it comes to Blockchain development. The only way to really learn Blockchain development is getting your hands dirty.

34,"There are a few options here.
You can always just keep them on an exchange that you use the most, but just like everyone else will point out that’s never recommended. Whenever there’s a third party controlling your wallet keys, the situation is less than ideal.
You can use a hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano or Trezor. If you have significant amounts of currencies, the investment in one of these can be justified. They still don’t support that many altcoins, but are a very safe option.
If you want to control your own keys, but don’t want to deal with the cost and some inconvenience that comes with a hardware wallet, you can opt for a browser based wallet like this one. It’s very straight forward and puts you in full control of all the information. Make sure to save your private key on a piece of paper or a hard drive, just to have “a copy”.

35,"There are 3 coins that are seeking to replace Ethereum with their somewhat similar concept.
Whether that will happen or not? Come on, no one can predict the future… but let’s take a deeper look.
NEO (NEO) - Recently rebranded… Used to be called Antshares.
It's very comparable to Ethereum, acting as a decentralized peer-to-peer network. It allows individual investors to take part in decentralized financial exchanges and like Ethereum, the token can be used for raising equity or crowdfunding.
NEO plans to tackle many of the scaling issues that tripped up Ethereum, resulting in the loss of confidence by many investors. Handling these issues before massive market exposure will be very positive for the digital currency in the future.
Deeper explanation of NEO
EOS (EOS)
EOS is an open source platform, like Ethereum, that will support decentralized applications.
But, unlike Ethereum, the proposed platform is far simpler, allowing businesses to develop decentralized applications without a heavy technical background. The tools are going to be built into the program. And, this makes EOS a phenomenal tool for companies that are trying to control and monitor information flow without too many complications.
All of these traits should have Ethereum shaking in its boots.
But it's important to remember that EOS is just a concept. A company can say as much as it wants to about a product, but until it's been tested, the company's claims should be taken with a grain of salt.
Deeper Explanation of EOS
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
Ethereum Classic split from Ethereum and are promising to become a leading digital payment option in the near future.
As much as the Ethereum Classic are similar to Ethereum, ETC is creating dedicated mining pools and users can personalize their website using ETC widgets to advertise and show support for the classic network.
They supposedly have a better user interface that is user friendly and easier to work with as a miner. Their network upgrade accommodates more features translating in to more flexibility for developers on their network.
Deeper Explanation of Ethereum Classic
There are many coins that are competing with Ethereum in concept. With cryptocurrency, there are so many layers in which make each one very very unique.
The 3 coins mentioned above, I believe relate to your question the most as to which cryptos are trying to compete or “replace” Ethereum.

36,"The blockchain is decentralized technology. A global network of computer uses blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That is, bitcoin is managed by its network, and not anyone central authority. A blockchain is a database with user distributed validation. Bitcoin was designed to be just a cryptocurrency, so it uses blockchain to record the bitcoin transaction. Meanwhile, there was designed to help developers create decentralized applications, and it uses blockchain to run an application programming code. The blockchain is a digital ledger that provides a secure way of making and recording a transaction, agreement, and contracts anything that needs to be recorded and verified as having taken place.
Simply, blockchain is a digital record of transactions.

How it’s Work:
A wallet is an address on the Blockchain. Someone wanting to conduct a transaction must send a message with the transaction signed with their private key. The computers in the network holding the Blockchain are called nodes. Miners place transactions in blocks in response to proof of work challenges.
What are the benefits?
Transparency
Reduced Transaction Costs
Faster Transaction Deal
Decentralization
User-Controlled Network
Efficiency
Auditability
Traceability

How many types of blockchain are there?
1) Public Blockchain
This is the model of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, and could be thought of as the original distributed ledger structure. For a number of reasons, it is still considered by many to be the prototype for all Blockchains, although it is not without drawbacks.
2) Private Blockchain
The permission Blockchain is a closed and monitored ecosystem where the access of each participant is well defined and differentiated based on role. They are built for a purpose, establishing rules for a transaction that align with the needs of an organization or a consortium of organizations.
3) Consortium Blockchain
A consortium Blockchain is a Blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid.
What is Blockchain technology in healthcare?
Blockchain Technology and the Healthcare revolution. At a very high level, Blockchain technology is a system that records transactions on linked blocks and stores them in encrypted registers. The Blockchain era has already begun. Taking into account the fast progress in the development of new and more efficient healthcare record systems, wearable devices, and medical examination systems implementing artificial intelligence, cryptography will become an important part of the way hospitals work.

What is Blockchain technology in the Banking Sector?
The banking industry is strictly regulated in all jurisdictions, while banking sector representatives are distinguished by their conservative attitudes. But the wide dissemination of Blockchain in the recent years, the overwhelming popularity of cryptocurrencies, and the ICO boom have contributed to the fact that the management of many banks and financial organizations no longer deny the potential of Blockchain technology.
Large banks are increasingly conducting tests of decentralized asset technology and implementing Blockchain in business processes. Banks continue to invest in a variety of projects and start-ups that are developing Blockchain-based solutions.

37,"I got 10 things about blockchain and crypto that almost no one knows about.
That 70% of blockchains are extremely centralized and scam their investors by talking about decentralization, freedom and other lovey-dovey buzzwords while they stab you in the back with not giving a damn about decentralization

Most new coins coming out with market caps in the billions grab investor money by saying they have such high scalability, however, nobody notices that they are all at the heavy cost of decentralization and thus useless (EOS, NEO, Ripple, Stellar, Dash, Tron are all extremely centralized)
Marius Kramer's answer to What is the most decentralized cryptocurrency?
That CEOs and CTOs of multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency companies don’t know what decentralization is and they actually believe their blockchains are decentralized even though they aren’t decentralized at all. Their investors also believe them, because they have no idea how to judge the technology.
That the only blockchains that are actually decentralized AND scalable aren’t even blockchains anymore (Holochain, Nano, IOTA), so the concept of a blockchain will most likely become completely obsolete in the near future
Of the 902 cryptocurrency ICOs formed in 2017, 142 failed before raising any funds, and 276 failed after fundraising.

Another 113 ICOs fall under the ""semi-failed"" category, either because the respective startup ceased communicating on social media, or the community dwindled to the point where it has virtually no chance of success. Toss those figures into the pile and the failure rate rises to 59 percent Those figures combined work out to a 46 percent failure rate, despite raising over $104 million.. Cryptocurrency ICOs have a spectacularly high failure rate
Only 50 out of 902 ICOs in 2017 made a 5x return or more. News, data and analytics for all ICO’s and tokens

7 out of the top 10 coins will probably die this year, but they still mislead their investors that they are a great coin. Of the top 10 crypto coins by market cap, which do you believe is most likely to fail, and why?
The blockchain market is almost entirely controlled by whales. They own 40% of all Bitcoins, totalling $70B. They can increase the market cap of Bitcoin from $100B to $1T in a heartbeat if they wanted to. However, they wait for natural market cycles and then pump those.
It’s extremely difficult to detect flawed consensus algorithms and centralization issues such as in EOS, NEO, Ripple, Stellar, Dash, Tron are all extremely centralized. A person without a deep background in computer science and a deep background in business, lots of training to remove personal biases, has almost no chance in detecting coins that scam investors.

38,"What is Blockchain technology?
A Blockchain is a decentralized ledger for all bitcoin transactions are having been executed. A block is the “present” part of a Blockchain which records some or all of the latest transactions, and once completed that goes into the Blockchain as a permanent record. The blockchain is an initial technology: that has the potential to make new foundations for our financial and social systems.
Various type of coolest Blockchain applications are:
Payment and money transfers via Blockchain:
As noted, with banks removed from the equation, and confirmation of transactions continuing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, most transactions processed over a Blockchain can be developed within a matter of seconds.
Digital voting:
Using the Blockchain technology as a voter might check that his or her vote was successfully transmitted while remains anonymous to the rest of the world. In 2014, Liberal Alliance, a political party in Denmark, became the first party to use Blockchain to vote.
Decentralized notary:
As a trustless decentralized network, it fundamentally confirms the existence of at a stated time that is further verifiable in a court of law. Until now, only centralized notary services could serve this purpose. Blockchain as a public database, it is a distributed sort of consensus; your document becomes qualified in a distributed sort of way.
Smart contracts:
Smart contracts are digital which are rooted with an if-this-then-that (IFTTT) code, which gives them self-execution. Once the definite conditions are met, funds would be released and sent to the suitable party as per terms. Smart contracts have the possible to disintermediate the legal and financial fields in particular, by simplifying and automate routine.

39,"Let’s think about this for a bit.
The promise of the blockchain is that it’s immutable, and public, and distributed. Once a transaction is recorded, it’s there, forever. Got it?
OK, think about your life, and how you handle your bills - mortgage or rent, car payment, insurance, power, water, credit cards, etc. So, you have that in your head, right? Pretty good idea how that works, which ones get paid when, etc?
Add to that how you get paid - salary from your employer, fees for consulting, selling cans at the recycling center, whatever.
Now.
Imagine this future in which ALL OF THAT is on the blockchain, forever.
Admittedly, there’s this ambiguation component: the ID of a given wallet is used, and there is in theory no way to tie that to you, individually.
Until there is.
Let’s say that I develop a keen interest in what your financial life looks like. And I want to know your wallet ID. Simple enough: all I need to do is arrange to pay you, or be paid by you, and bingo, I have your ID.
Now all I need to do is walk the blockchain looking for all instances, and I’ll know what you’re doing - where payments are sent, where inbound payments come from. Over a sufficiently long period - call it a year, probably less - of payment history, I can figure it out. That big one, that’s probably your house. The next bigger ones, your car. And utilities and credit card companies - they probably have a public wallet ID published for all inbound payments, so that’s easy.
With a modest amount of work, I can figure it all out. 80% or so will be trivial, the rest will take some work - and require that I am sufficiently interested to pursue it.
Now, if I’m careful and willing to run multiple wallets, and work hard to actively obscure what I’m doing with my money, I can make it harder. But just remember, EVERY transaction is on the chain. EVERY. Each and all, no exceptions.
So even if I have one wallet for inbound and one for outbound payments and one to store coin in while I’m waiting to make payments, all of those addresses are known, and on the chain.
Now, in truth, that’s much the case today. It doesn’t take a great deal of effort - just a great deal of motivation - to completely peel someone’s financial life apart. Competent private investigators can do that for the public; financial investigators in law enforcement do that day in, day out as well. So this is NOT new.
The difference is, to my way of thinking, some random stalker-person is less likely to take interest in doing that to you today because it’s harder, takes effort and skills and in the best cases access to your trash and recycling.
But on the chain? I can do that from anywhere with network access. I don’t need access to your recycling to see your bills, I see it all, all the time.
And here’s the part that of which most people are actually terrified. Let’s say you have a part of your life that’s well, let’s just say not completely public. Buying porn or sex toys, your alcohol consumption, collecting Rick Astley memorabilia, whatever, something you really don’t want other people knowing about.
Today, if you do that on credit card, that you did it is not obvious, and if you paid your credit card bill on the blockchain, that purchase is obscured into the aggregate amount of your monthly bill, along with trips to Starbucks, buying groceries, and whatnot.
However, if in this future all purchases are on the chain….
Yeah.
Makes you long for the good old days where you could just use

Crypto theft is rampant. $673 million were stolen in crypto hacks in 2018 , with $9M stolen every day. This is because it is much easier to steal crypto than bank funds, since security isn’t as mature yet.
Newbie investors will always buy in during the height of a bull run, thus buying high almost at the peak. A few weeks later, the market has crashed and all of them have lost 70% of their money. Newbies never buy when the market is down, like currently. They buy high and sell low. Thus, for every experienced crypto investor, there are several newbie investors that the experienced investor profits off.
The market is almost entirely controlled by whales. They own 40% of all Bitcoins, totalling $70B. They can increase the market cap of Bitcoin from $100B to $1T in a heartbeat if they wanted to. However, they wait for natural market cycles and then pump those.

42,"Every technology has it’s limitations and they evolve eventually or risk becoming obsolete. Blockchain has come a long way since it’s inception in Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain has Scalability problems, Latency issues and many more. But since this question isn’t about one Blockchain technology in particular, I would answer it in a more general way.
Desire to apply it in all domains without proper reasoning:
There is not much understanding of the Blockchain technologies and the advantages they provide over existing technologies. A lot of developers are trying to use Blockchain as a solution to every problem that’s out there.
Desire to ride the Hype :
Blockchain technologies aren’t mature yet. They are developing and evolving every day. A lot of products that are being developed as a POC on a Blockchain aren’t even Blockchain secure. For ex, they store the data on a database and store the hash on Blockchain. In this case the application will still have a single point of failure in the form of the database. All it does is add Blockchain unnecessarily to a already working application.
Self certified experts and evangelists :
Talking about Blockchain makes people sound cool, and others give attention to anyone who knows anything remotely related to Blockchain. This has lead to a lot of experts who can’t technically explain Blockchain, which in result hurts the future development of the solutions based on the technology.
Lack of technical awareness :
This is an extension of the previous point. People don’t actually know much about blockchain technologies. And this has a far reaching consequence. Most of them aren’t able to ask pertinent questions. Due to the lack of question, the improvement in the technology gets delayed. Case in point, Bitcoin blockchain. They haven’t increased the block size, even though it has been under discussion since past 2 years.
But I think, similar to internet, all these limitations will be overcome eventually.

43,"There are several commonalities between the two projects, but also important differences. First of all, both are decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms implemented on top of a blockchain. In that respect they are very similar. Our differences fall in four categories: governance, smart-contracts, consensus, and general philosophy.
Governance

Ethereum demarked itself from Bitcoin by its low reluctance to hardfork in order to upgrade its network or correct perceived issues with its operations. Tezos shares Ethereum’s point of view on the importance of keeping the protocol dynamic and evolving but we take a different approach. In Tezos, protocol upgrades are formally proposed on the blockchain and voted upon by the stakeholders according to preset governance rules. If the proposal is adopted, the proposal is compiled and automatically moves on to the Tezos testnet. After a period of testing, a confirmation vote is held and if successful the testnet is automatically promoted to the main network. This lets us upgrade without having to hard fork. Ethereum considers that it is important to give users the discretion to follow the upgrade or not. We think it’s problematic for several reason. Most notably:
In such a discretionary choice, users’ interest is in following what they perceive as the “legitimate” choice, not the one they necessarily deem best. This gives, de facto, enormous power to the core development team and the Ethereum foundation. This dynamic is known as a “Keynesian beauty contest”.
As these systems grow, users tend to become more passive members of their community. This makes it harder and harder to muster the amount of coordination required by a hard fork. This creates a bias towards stagnation which may be suboptimal. Some amount of bias towards conservativism in protocol upgrade is desirable, but we would rather have stakeholders chose it explicitly than having it be imposed by external circumstances.
Smart-contracts

Like Ethereum, Tezos possesses a rich, Turing complete, smart contract language which can create covenants around its tokens. Ethereum’s approach was to build a very low level virtual machine, the EVM, and then to develop high level languages on top of it, the most successful of which is Solidity. We take a different approach. Our base language, Michelson, has both aspects of a low level language: it manipulates a stack, like Bitcoin and doesn’t use variables or named functions and aspects of high level language: it is statically typed, purely functional, and offers maps, sets, lists, cryptographic primitives, and arbitrary precision integers out of the box.

Ethereum’s EVM attempts to be as neutral and efficient as possible. It is designed to be, as its name implies, a “virtual machine”. This comes at a cost. The contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are stored as EVM code, which makes them extremely hard to analyze due to the complexity of reasoning about such a low level language. While it is possible to attach Solidity sources, it is not always possible to make sure that the two source code describe exactly the same contract. This is because the Solidity compiler isn’t certified. This type of subtleties can create potentially devastating bugs like this one.

We took the view that most smart contracts only need to implement very simple business logic. It is far more important for them to be correct than to be extremely efficient. Even if a contract does involve heavy computations, those computations can typically be performed off-chain, leaving the smart-contract to deal only with the relatively lightweight transaction logic.

There are efforts underway to use formal verification to prove properties of Ethereum contracts, but such efforts typically need to overcome large constraints inherent in the design of the EVM or Solidity. Michelson was designed from day 1 to be an easy target for formal verification.
Consensus

Tezos is launching with a pure proof-of-stake consensus protocol while Ethereum relies on proof-of-work. While Ethereum does plan to move to proof-of-stake, the two algorithms are qualitatively different.

Ethereum’s proposed proof-of-stake algorithm relies on a set of bonded validators to create blocks. These validators earn rewards for the function they perform for the network. These rewards eventually dilute the holdings of other participants.

Tezos’ proof-of-stake algorithm is designed so that stakeholders are called upon to create blocks and receive rewards randomly and in proportion to their holdings. This means that even a very small holder can have a chance to create a block and receive a reward. This means that only users who do not participate in the consensus algorithm become diluted, as opposed to almost everyone.
General philosophy

Tezos has a few philosophical differences in how it approaches its design.
Thin vs Fat protocol, appcoins

Ethereum aims to be a thin protocol layer. A consensus mechanism to power the EVM upon which real applications are built. These applications are then generally expected to issue their own tokens, or “appcoins”. In contrast, Tezos aims to be a fat protocol layer with many features.

While Tezos does support the creation of appcoins, we do not put any emphasis on them. While these applications can create demand for the underlying token in order to power smart-contract, they also end up diluting it. In many cases, the token is being shoehorned into an application that does not need a separate token nor benefits from one. We do not think this is a sustainable model.

The preferred way for Tezos to gain features is by protocol amendments. For instance, native support of prediction markets can be done at the protocol level. A developer could propose an amendment introducing such support and attach an invoice to the amendment in order to get rewarded if the amendment is selected.
Developer community

Ethereum designed Solidity to be similar to JavaScript in order to appeal to a large number of developers. We do not think this approach is a good fit for smart contracts. Smart contracts need to be developed with great care, and their failure can taint the reputation of the platform. It is better to appeal to a moderate number of highly talented programmer than to go for breadth. Many useful applications can be built on top of these ledgers without using smart contracts, and for those applications we have a convenient JSON API.

Overall, one gets the impression that Ethereum tends to see developers as their users, while Tezos is more focused on the end users themselves.

45,"A blockchain, or distributed ledger, is mostly known for the first technology it enabled, the Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto first described in a paper in 2008.
I will try to provide a general overview of the technology and its potential, from both practical and technical perspectives, which you should be able to understand without any previous knowledge on the blockchain.
Today, cryptocurrencies in circulation alone have a market capitalisation of well over ten billion dollars and new start-ups relying on the blockchain are funded every day, fulfilling the thirst of venture capitalists for the technology. What blockchain promises to solve is a long-standing computer science issue discussed since the early 1970’s and generalised in 1982 as the Byzantine Generals’ Problem which essentially asks how multiple cooperating parties can reach common knowledge about a factual element when there exists some malicious actors actively trying to spread incorrect information and who have a certain likelihood of intercepting and altering every direct communication between individuals. Until now, this problem would usually be addressed by relying on a trusted central authority, but for the first time, blockchain allows any such consensus to be reached without having to place trust in any single entity. Much has been written on the societal changes blockchain will bring, the challenges governments will need to address or even how a new body of law, Lex Cryptographia, will be needed to adjust to this new paradigm.
Technical Overview
Blockchain’s solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is to impose to every actor who wants to share some information to also solve a very complex mathematical puzzle (called block) that proves a large amount of work has been invested. Thanks to complex mathematical properties, it is possible to design problems that are hard to compute, but easy to verify; this is actually the reverse of the popular concept of asymmetric keys encryption in the field of cryptography, which powers most modern secured communication protocols and in which we want to generate puzzles that are easy to compute (creating the key) but hard to verify (cracking the key). Each block contains a hash (a string of characters), that has to refer cryptographically to the hash of the previous block (to guarantee the chronological order). Together, this serie of blocks, up to the genesis block (the only block hardcoded into the blockchain’s core script), form the blockchain. The computational difficulty of generating a valid block mostly stems from the randomness of the process of finding a new hash that will correctly connect to the hash of the previous block.
A copy of the blockchain database (of about 80 gigabytes today for the Bitcoin blockchain, but continuously growing as more blocks are appended) as well as the core script that contains the rules of what should be considered a valid blockchain are stored on every computer (called full node) that is willing to be part of the network. In addition to the hash, each block stores a large amount of information (called transactions). Anyone who wants to get information stored in the database can do so by querying from any node of the network; if some nodes disagree on what should be the correct state of the blockchain, one will always trust the longest valid blockchain (i.e. the full node that can prove his version of the blockchain required more computational effort than all the other existing versions), which honest nodes will actively be searching for to replace their own version of the chain. It is also possible that multiple blockchain temporarily have the same length, in which case one has to wait until further blocks are added to be able to distinguish which version of the blockchain one should trust. As a general rule, the older a block is in the chain, the more trustworthy it is, because an attacker would have to start and re-create a much larger fraction of the blockchain to replace it.
Most individuals who want to add some transactions into the blockchain do not have the computing power or the time necessary to find a valid block. In that case, they will add their transaction into a pool of unconfirmed transactions that are waiting for a professional block generator (called a miner) to find a block for them. When a miner finds a valid block, which is a really rare event, he will include in it as many transactions as the block allows for (currently one megabyte for the bitcoin blockchain) and broadcast it to all the full nodes of the blockchain, that will append the block to the chain after having checked its validity. In most blockchains, when a miner successfully adds a block to the chain, he receives a reward from the system as well a fee perceived from the individuals whose transaction has been included (optional, normally only included when there is a congestion of unconfirmed transactions, to help miners prioritise which transaction to include first).
The underlying assumption of the process is that the total effort invested by honest miners is greater than the total effort invested by those with malicious intents. By effort, one should understand money, since computational difficulty directly relates to electricity and hardware costs. Each individual involved in the process owns a public and a private key. Your public key identifies you and can be used by anyone to see what contributions you have made to the blockchain (e.g. how much money you possess in the case of a cryptocurrency blockchain). Using your private key, you can generate transactions that are cryptographically guaranteed to originate from you. By this process, even if a malicious actor were to control a majority of the blockchain’s computing power, its power, through what is called a 51% attack, would be limited to cancelling recent transactions and blocking new transactions from occurring; stealing money from other accounts is impossible without knowing the private key of the targeted individuals. That way, by limiting the incentives for malicious actors to harm the system and creating strong rewards for people to reinforce the system, we make the blockchain an extremely reliable decentralised ledger. So far, no such attack has ever been successful.
Modern uses & potential
The blockchain can be used in a large variety of applications. As of today however, the most widespread use of blockchains remains limited to cryptocurrencies, or more famously the bitcoin. It is only recently, with the introduction of the Ethereum network in July 2015, two years after being described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, that serious alternatives were made possible. The main innovation of the Ethereum was to introduce a Turing-complete programming language that supports all basic operations necessary to implement any algorithm, allowing to manipulate the Ethereum blockchain easily. These new kind of applications, powered by the Ethereum or similar blockchains, are what I will call the modern uses of the blockchain, as opposed to the traditional usage generally limited to digital currencies. In general, most of the value of the blockchain can be summarised in getting rid of the intermediaries, whether they are banks, lawyers or any entity, thus dramatically reducing agency and coordination costs.
Digital currencies and payment systems. While traditionally done through the Bitcoin network, payment systems will probably remain the main use of the blockchain for a few more years. With the introduction of better blockchains such as the Ethereum (which also supports payment systems), distributed digital payments are increasingly made easier, faster and cheaper. Through the blockchain, businesses could get rid of transaction fees, which often consume a large fraction of the margins in the retail industry, and automate payments without depending on banks. Such payment systems would be especially valuable in developing markets or countries with unstable currencies
Online Privacy. Today, a factor that slows down technology adoption for many individuals, corporations or governments is privacy concerns and the fear of handing out too much control to other entities. But the blockchain would allow everybody to take advantage of new technologies, such as cloud storage of personal biometric information, while maintaining complete control over their data, even from governments, due to cryptographic encryption. This would be of great value for example for corporations who focus on selling hardware or services, such as Walmart or even Apple, but of lesser value to corporations whose value creation reside in owning data, such as Google and Facebook.
Smart contracts. They can be considered as the building block of modern blockchain applications. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements written in code instead of words and enforced by the blockchain instead of courts. Blockchains that support external scripting, such as Ethereum, generally make the implementation of such contracts very easy with only a few lines of code.

Most traditional contracts could potentially be partially or fully implemented in a smart contract. The more objective the evaluation of the outcome is, the easier it is to draft such a contract. A classic example would be an online advertising agency selling search engine optimisation services, with the promise that the client’s website will appear on the first page of a specified search engine for a given keyword within 30 days. Such services generally appear very suspicious because they are often provided on the web by unknown companies based in a foreign country, but an example implementation of such a contract only requires a few rules:

- Start contract when both parties have sent agreed bitcoin amount to account managed by the smart contract (stored in the blockchain). If no amount is received within 7 days, cancel contract and send back all money received.

- After 30 days, check the search engine’s URL that corresponds to the selected keyword. If given website is in the URL’s source code, send all the money of the contract’s account to the agency; otherwise, send it all back to the customer (including the penalty for failed execution).

More advanced and larger scale contracts can easily take place, especially in the financial sector where trust plays a central role and allows intermediaries to justify hefty commissions in all trades. A multisignature escrow account, futures contract, any financial derivative or commodity trading with completely eliminated counterparty risk can be implemented just as easily using a similar stratagem; here the trust would be reduced to one agent only: the stock exchange that publicly displays the stock prices on its website, used as the source of truth when the contract triggers the settlement.

Smart contracts not only eliminate enforcement costs, they also get rid of ambiguity and make all business dealings instantaneous: if a specified condition is met, the blockchain immediately releases the fund and all other digital assets as specified by the contract.
Smart property, also known as colored coins. Pushing the limits even further, the blockchain allows for cryptographically activated assets. Those could be either physical or digital and would take the form of a token; whoever possesses the token, which can be easily exchanged and transferred like any other digital currency, owns the asset. Those assets could be real estate (e.g. a house whose door only opens to people in possession of the token), objects (e.g. diamonds whose transactions are only recognized by governments if sold with a valid token, reducing trafficking and making it easier to verify their authenticity) or intellectual property (e.g. patent ownership that can be traced back to the entity owning the patent’s token, or music royalties that are sent automatically to the owner of the token associated with the rights to the songs).

Some of these systems would require full support from the government as it currently manages most of the existing ledgers, e.g. land registries that often require a lengthy and costly administrative procedure to access or to change, often necessitating the services of a notary in case of a sale. But the private sector will play a key role in defining how those evolutions take place and, potentially, whether it can take over some of these functions that used to require the government—a trusted central authority—but can now be handed over to the blockchain.
Decentralised name registration. A natural extension to smart property is decentralized name registration: the first individual to add a certain name to the blockchain, if it did not exist already, receives “ownership” of that name. This could be used to manage internet domain names, traditionally a responsibility of registry operators who owned a monopoly on a specific top level domain (e.g. Verisign for the .com). In the case of domain names, the blockchain could require from individuals to pay a yearly fee to maintain ownership, which would be used to cover mining costs or would be sent automatically to the government as a tax.

We could further generalise the registration of names to more abstract concepts such as texts, images, videos or even ideas: the first to submit automatically gains ownership of intellectual property.
Decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs). When smart contracts are bundled together, they can sometimes form what is called a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). While there is not yet a formally agreed upon definition of the concept, DAOs can be understood as regular organisations except that, instead of following the lead of human managers, they have an automated governance encoded in smart contracts. The most famous implementation of a DAO was the venture capital fund sobrely called The DAO that (despite later issues that led to its shut down) raised over a hundred million USD over a crowdfunding campaign in May 2016. Contrary to traditional funds, shareholders of The DAO do not elect a board to represent them but are directly involved in the operational activities and investment decisions.

Wikipedia is a perfect example of organisation that could have benefited from the blockchain. Its organisational structure is really close to that of a DAO, with most of its content being generated by its community and all decisions being made through a democratic process. Yet, without the blockchain, the Wikimedia Foundation had to rely on a few individuals to manage the organisation, such as the executive director, vested with special powers. This creates conflicts of interest, even within a non-profit. A Wikipedia DAO could easily be implemented, thus removing the need for human representatives and making Wikipedia truly neutral and independent.

Similarly to smart contracts, not even its creators can control a DAO once deployed in the blockchain (unless special provisions have been written in the initial code). Large networks of DAOs could grow to become artificially intelligent clusters of computer programmes with control over physical assets, similarly to how machine learning neural networks work, bringing us a bit closer to the technological singularity.
Costs and risks
Reduced control. The blockchain is attractive for its unmatched level of security. You can trust it to protect the integrity of your data more than you would trust any bank or government. But it will do so indiscriminately and will not protect you from your own mistakes. Once a smart contract is released into the blockchain, no one can stop it, not even you. If by mistake you forgot to add a clause that indicates where to send the funds back when the contract is cancelled, the money will stay forever lost in the blockchain. Worse, if you design a harmful contract that incentivises illegal behavior (e.g. by automatically remunerating individuals who publish terrorist content) and equip it with large financial resources, neither remorse nor an injunction will be of any effect to stop it.
Latency. The blockchain is not as reactive as traditional databases. This is the cost to pay for security: for each block and each transaction we add, the nodes need to run many time-consuming checks that insure they comply with the rules defined by the core script. In addition, many blockchains artificially adjust the level of “difficulty” of the mining to make sure the blockchain doesn’t grow too fast. In the bitcoin for example, a new block is only added about every ten minutes, which is why transactions take a few minutes on average to be confirmed. Recent blockchains such as Ethereum have been able to decrease that delay to about fifteen seconds between each block, but that remains far too slow for real-time applications.
Storage costs. One of the fundamental properties of the blockchain is that it has to conserve the full history of the transactions and thus will forever grow over time. In addition, its distributed nature requires thousands of nodes to make copies of the entire blockchain, and to store it on a well connected computer with a high bandwidth. As a result, storage costs are thousands of times higher than any other solution, making it largely impractical at the moment to store more than a few bytes of text, let alone images or videos.
Mining costs and risks. Mining represents the majority of the costs in traditional blockchains that rely on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm, such as the Bitcoin. As explained earlier, the blockchain makes it artificially difficult to create a new block (thus very costly in electricity and hardware) to protect the network from 51% attacks. The drawback is that to provide a decent level of security, indecent amounts of electricity need to be wasted, which is not only expensive but also leaves a terrible environmental footprint. At the current value of the bitcoin, a few million dollars worth of electricity are consumed every day by bitcoin miners alone.

The theoretical foundations of PoW incentives stem from game theory: if the rewards for a successful attack are lower than the costs, no rational individual should attempt an attack. As we saw, the rewards for a successful attack are limited as it is impossible to steal money without also knowing the private key of individuals. As for the costs, with PoW they come from two components: the initial investment (to acquire the necessary hardware) and the electricity. The cost of controlling the network will be proportional to the duration of the attack, as the attacker has to keep finding valid blocks faster than the honest nodes to maintain its blockchain longer than the honest blockchain. But with the recent advances in cloud computing, it has become cheap to rent a large CPU capacity for a very short period of time with little upfront investment. In addition, economies of scale and geographic differences in electricity and hardware prices have created strong incentives for miners to pool their resources, making the system more vulnerable.

Blockchains can remunerate miners for their effort either by generating new currency or by perceiving a fee on each transaction. The former will create inflation and is thus equivalent to a “wealth tax” (since each coin loses a fraction of its value), whereas the latter is equivalent to a “value added tax” (or “financial transaction tax”); both kinds of taxation have been active topics of research in public policy for a long time and have well-understood advantages and inconvenients. There is also a trade-off between the desired level of security and the cost of running the blockchain, thus incentive levels might have to be adjusted depending on the criticality of the infrastructure.

A promising alternative to PoW is Proof-of-Stake (PoS). With PoS, the network is protected as long as honest participants own at least 51% of all the assets at stake. Here, the incentive system has to be built in a way that makes anyone who successfully carries an attack lose as much wealth as possible. Many variations of PoS have been suggested, such as the Casper algorithm —expected to replace PoW in Ethereum soon—, in which individuals can “bet” coins on which block they believe will be added to the blockchain next. In such cases, the only circumstances in which participants will make non-hedgeable losses at betting is if the network is successfully attacked: this very low probability event is similar to a “systematic risk” in finance, and the gains made on successful bets can be compared to the “risk-free” return offered by government bonds. Just as for government bonds, all participants in such a blockchain should invest all their “assets” into the “betting” to gain the “risk-free” return unless they are too risk-averse to agree to increase their exposure to the “systematic risk” (to which they are exposed anyway whether they bet or not).

We can actually show that consensus-by-bet PoS can be modelled as a subset of PoW displaying similar mining incentives except that the cost of carrying a successful attack against the network is not proportional to the duration of the attack but roughly constant (since your stake is likely to lose most of its value if you attack the network). This is a desirable property as the social cost of an attack is generally better represented by a fixed value than by a linear function of time. Assuming that most cryptocurrencies owners participate in the betting process, it also makes it easy to raise the cost of an attack to billions of dollars instead of millions. PoW also practically eliminates electricity consumption and, incidentally, makes possible several improvements to raise the speed of the network.

Note that if financial instruments allowing speculators to take highly leveraged short positions on the blockchain exist (for example by shorting the stock of companies that have invested heavily in the technology), attackers will start having financial incentives to take the network down.
Sybil attacks. Another less discussed vulnerability of the blockchain is its full nodes. If copies of the entire blockchain are not stored on enough computers, attackers can potentially fill the network with clients controlled by them and partially take down the system through what is called a Sybil attack. Malicious nodes are only problematic if they are so prominent that finding honest nodes becomes too time consuming, thus it is required to control much more than half of the network to inflict a generalised failure.

Increasing the mining incentives will not necessarily improve the protection against sybil attacks, but a certain number of measures are generally put in place to make these attacks difficult, such as limiting the number of outbound connections per ip address. So far, blockchains have never really lacked of full nodes so research efforts have been concentrated in other areas. If sybil vulnerabilities become critical (for example because hosting full becomes too costly), it might be necessary to provide financial incentives to people running full nodes.
Mitigation and recovery. While vulnerability to attacks and to human mistakes are a major weakness of the blockchain, recent events have shown that possibilities of mitigation play a huge role in the credibility of the system, in particular with regards to forking, which can sometimes allow an almost full recovery of lost or stolen funds.

In June 2016, a vulnerability in the smart contracts behind The DAO allowed a hacker to steal over fifty million dollars from the fund. While this was not due to a failure of the Ethereum blockchain but only to the bad implementation of The DAO, the losses were of such large scale that they would strongly affect the Ethereum and put its survival at risk if nothing was done. The DAO had become a too big to fail financial institution that Ethereum (the “State” of this microeconomy) had to bail it out. Ethereum’s core developers thus released a patch that would essentially invalidate all the stolen funds, correct the vulnerability and bring back the Ethereum to its state just before the attack.

When a communication failure between nodes occurs or when only part of the nodes update their core script, the blockchain may split into two distinct versions. This is what we call a fork. Most of the time, forks are only temporary and disappear once all the nodes are synchronised. But sometimes, they come from a conscious decision from one part of the community to disregard certain changes made in the core blockchain script by the rest of the community. If both parties can rally enough support from stakeholders, both blockchains may subsist, having only in common the blocks history up to the breakup point. This is what happened when the DAO’s bailout patch was released: a significant portion of the community, against the bailout, decided to ignore it and to keep mining the old blockchain, which still exists today as Ethereum Classic, with a market capitalisation of about 10% of that of the patched Ethereum as of September 2016.

They now live as competitors. Despite both blockchains’ code being roughly identical, the split allowed both communities to make a strong statement to the world: Ethereum Classic is truly immutable and will not easily tolerate forks in the future, whereas Ethereum is likely to allow them again and even advertises them as a feature, an additional protection against potential attacks. The split could certainly have been avoided if Ethereum had taken a clear stand in favor of forks when it was first created, and businesses relying on a blockchain will have to decide whether they want to favor systems whose community supports voluntary forks or not. While a forking culture improves the mitigation potential, it can also backfire and overly empower core developers or a few individuals that can more easily impose their personal agenda to all the users of the blockchain.
Implementation and Monetisation
Beyond the hype, businesses realize that integrating such technologies might be just as hard as the transition to Big Data, both to implement and to extract value. Massive injection of funds will not suffice and some business models might prove more compatible than others, at least initially.
As decentralisation and getting rid of intermediaries are the main purpose, the blockchain is generally associated with open-source technologies and can appear as an enemy to modern capitalism. However, many successful bitcoin and blockchain startups have shown that the technology can be synergised effectively with paid services; this contrasts strongly with the traditional open-source community—in which users expect an integrally free service—in part because people are already expecting to pay fees due to mining costs necessary to guarantee the reliability of the blockchain. Consulting advice on blockchain can also be offered for governments or organisations that want to leverage the potential of blockchain, and IT consulting firms will quickly need to develop an expertise in that area to respond to the demand. Similarly, companies offering cloud computing services can include Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) into their offering. Universities will also observe a growing interest for both introductory and advanced blockchain courses in their computer science, economics and business degrees.
Firms can also use blockchains to externalise data sensitive components of their applications to decrease their compliance costs and risks of legal liability. If the company does not control the blockchain and only has ownership of the front-end built on top of it, it can only be sued for building the system, not for what becomes of it. This would add a layer of protection for companies operating in an uncertain legal environment. Most of all however, the value of the blockchain for organisations resides in its ability to streamline processes and improve vertical integration of the value-chain by getting rid of costly intermediaries and by simplifying coordination. This will be especially valuable for very fragmented industries that rely heavily on external partners or for companies that trade in a market with a generally low level of trust or high level of uncertainty, such as in many developing countries.
As for many modern technologies, the early business adopters will probably be start-ups, which can absorb a larger amount of risk and whose dynamism allows for better capacities to adapt to the fast-changing environment of blockchain. Businesses that will be the most at risk are those whose purpose is already to decrease coordination costs, such as banks and law firms, but are also the ones that have the most to gain by adapting. Lawyers for example could expand their services to include smart contracts drafting and bankers could design complex financial instruments living in the blockchain, offering a lot of transparency but requiring the competence of qualified financial advisors to be used appropriately.
While the blockchain presents significant opportunities for economic growth, it might often represent more of a threat for individual companies than an opportunity. It will decrease the overall need for both the private and public sectors, in favor of what we call the “autonomous sector”, a complex (somewhat chaotic) network of intertwined DAOs and smart contracts living in the blockchain, over which no one has control. In such cases, the financial incentive for businesses to understand the technology will be more about how to dodge the threat and adjust the offering to remain competitive than about how to extract value out of it. In particular, key differentiation arguments over which the blockchain might win market share are privacy, security, reliability and independence: if companies can improve their products on these characteristics, they might avoid losing the customers who are the most at risk of switching to the blockchain.
Most business uses of blockchain technologies will not require a dedicated blockchain. Use-cases can generally be satisfied easily through smart contracts encoded on networks supporting scripting, such as Ethereum, or by developing applications that rely on existing blockchains, such as a payment systems powered by the Bitcoin.
Recently, private blockchains have been suggested as alternatives to public blockchains. Contrary to regular blockchains, private blockchains can only be modified or mined by a pre-approved network of computers, with a reading access potentially also restricted. Adding and approving transactions could for example be limited to a consortium of banks who trust each other to a certain extent, with the requirement that each transaction has to be confirmed by at least a certain percentage of the participants. With private blockchains, as the number of participants is limited and known in advance, PoW or PoS can be replaced by proof-of-membership (to a set of hard-coded authorised public keys). Obviously, such systems lose most of the desirable properties that made the blockchain so innovative in the first place (including proof-of-work itself), but they offer an original approach to partially decentralised consensus with cryptographic auditability.
Conclusion
Most current implementations of blockchain are unadapted for large-scale solutions. In particular, the Bitcoin community has shown great difficulties to scale and adapt its technologies. The blockchain revolution will not happen overnight, however trends are already emerging—often set by key actors quickly gaining influence—and the Ethereum system is imposing itself as the default option for modern blockchain applications. Further developments should make it highly usable and cost efficient for most business applications.
Where business will play the most important role in the initial phase of this technology is in providing expertise for both private and public sectors through consultancy services and executive education, in complementing the current cloud computing offering with Blockchain-as-a-Service, in commercialising front-end applications on top of existing blockchains (e.g. e-wallet on top of the Bitcoin or smart contract drafting on top of Ethereum) for business and consumers and in leveraging private blockchains for internal uses. Blockchain should also be considered as a valid threat and direct competitor by many industries for long-term strategic planning.
The blockchain by itself is of limited value, just as internet and most popular programming languages—all open-source technologies—did not benefit most to their inventors but to those who managed to create value on top of them. The key will be to identify the segments of the value chain of each industry for which the market values decentralisation from the segments for which the market values most the quality of the service and to focus on the latter. Today, practical limitations will orient which technologies we should put on a blockchain, but hopefully future developments such as proof-of-stake will make the blockchain just another database system that companies can choose from.

Read a few different answers on this Quora thread, as well as watching one of my favorite blockchain Youtube videos below. This is not my channel… I just think this guy did a really great job in breaking it down.
How Does a Blockchain Work? - Simply Explained
Below is my typed explanation of Blockchain Technology.
A lot of people may not realize that blockchain technology is likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades… We may have thought it was social media or even artificial intelligence but In a way I don’t believe it is and here’s why.
Blockchain is the next generation of the internet as we know it… It’s a technology that has many applications and holds vast promise for every business, society and individual person reading this answer.
In order for you to understand Blockchain, I need you to understand how the internet currently operates. So, for the past few decades we have been living in what’s called “The Internet of Information”
When I am sending you a Word document, PowerPoint, Email or text message, I’m not actually sending you the original, I’m sending you a copy...
Which is great! This is democratized information.
But when it comes to financial assets, things like:
Money
Bonds
Futures
Intellectual Property
Energy
Music
Art
Voting
Sending you a copy is a really bad idea… If I’m sending you $100 its pretty important that I don’t still have the money…
This has been called the Double Spend problem by cryptographers for quite a long time. So today, we rely entirely on big intermediaries such as:
Governments
Social Media Companies
Credit Card Companies
Banks
These intermediaries establish trust and certainty with every transaction of value.
These intermediaries perform every type of transactional logic from every kind of commerce from authentication and identification of people, clearing, settling and record keeping.
Overall they do a pretty good job. But there are growing problems…
They are Centralized, therefore creating one point of attack that hackers continue to breach.
A recent example being Equifax, publicly revealing that 143 million identities were stolen from their servers, therefore completing the biggest hack in human history. The old record was set by Home Depot just two years previous where a hacker gained access to over 50 million credit cards in less than a day.
These intermediaries Exclude billions of people from the global economy, for example, people that don’t have access or enough money to have a bank account.
They slow things down… It can take a second for an email to go around the world but it can take weeks for money to move through the banking system across the city, and they take a big piece of the action, 10-20% to send money to a different country.
They capture our data, our privacy is constantly being undermined and the biggest problem is that overall they’ve appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically.
We have wealth creation but growing social inequality.
What if there were not just an internet of information but an internet of value… Some kind of vast, global, distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody.
Where every kind of asset from money to music could be stored, moved, managed and exchanged all without powerful intermediaries. In other words, a native peer-peer medium, but for value. It’s called the Blockchain.
Before we dive into exactly how this innovative “Blockchain” technology works, I want to first dive into its first application, Bitcoin. By doing so, it will give me a chance to examine an actual case study in which this technology has already been implemented. Through this understanding you will be able to imagine ALL of the different possibilities and opportunity that Blockchain has to offer outside of Bitcoin.
So in 2008 the financial industry crashed, shortly after, an unknown person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto created a white paper in which it developed a protocol for a digital cash that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.
This seemingly simple act set off a spark, that… well ignited the world. It either has people excited, terrified or otherwise interested in many places.
All Bitcoin is, is a digital asset that can be bought, sold or exchanged between parties over the internet with little to no transaction fees, instantaneously anywhere in the world. Because of this, Bitcoin can be used to store value just like gold, silver and other types of investments. What makes Bitcoin so unique is unlike those other investments Bitcoin also serves as a digital currency in which you can use to buy products, services as well as make payments and exchange value directly and electronically.
However, different from other types of traditional currencies, such as the USD, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. In other words, it can function as an international medium of value, meaning it is not jurisdictional, or Fiat therefore putting no limits onto its reach. Anyone that can access the web with the most basic of a device can now transact and exchange value internationally.
What a lot of people may or may not realize, is that it is (literally) 10 million times more flexible than our current USD cash system. Most people believe in order to buy Bitcoin they have to buy an entire coin. That is not true… Just like gold, you don’t have to exchange an entire gold bar for a loaf of bread… We have developed a system of cash/notes that break down the value of Gold into increments of one hundreds, fifty’s, twenty’s, tens, fives, singles, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
When buying, selling or exchanging Bitcoin, the minimum or maximum amount that one can exchange hardly exists… Therefore, I do not have to send an entire coin to transact with someone, even if Bitcoin’s price is at $10,000 dollars a coin, you can buy and exchange one dollar’s worth, or even a tenth of a penny’s worth! In fact, how I got the literal “10 million times more flexible” number is that a Bitcoin can actually be broken down into one hundred millionth of a coin. It’s called a Satoshi.
So, when you send Bitcoin to someone or use Bitcoin to buy anything, you don’t need to use a bank, credit card or any other type of third party intermediary. Instead, from your mobile device or computer, you can send Bitcoin directly to another party over the internet and it will arrive securely, almost instantly without being observed, analyzed or charged to the extent of our current digital payment systems. Think of it as the cash of the internet, except instead of physically handing it to someone we can now exchange it at the simplicity level of an email or text message.
So how does this thing actually work? How are these transactions processed, and confirmed and what’s stopping someone from manipulating the transactions, such as hacking the network and sending themselves a million dollars? Is it owned by someone? How does it just “run on its own with Blockchain?”
Bitcoin is running on the Blockchain, for a second I want you to also imagine any other digital asset from music to energy are also ran on the Blockchain. With Blockchain the validity, integrity and transactional information are NOT centralized and controlled by one group, in one place, like a bank or credit card company… but instead posted live to a network that is operated and validated by millions of people called miners.
The case study I like to use to explain who these “miners” are, and how the Bitcoin network functions is, the taxi business. It was once a giant corporation, but with massive restrictions on scalability due to overhead costs of vehicles to provide for drivers. This industry was dramatically disrupted by Uber, a decentralized network of drivers with their own vehicles, time, resources and energy to provide service for the Uber network in exchange for money.
The only job of Uber is now to process, validate and confirm transactions and pick-ups. The system is now set up as a decentralized incentive structure for drivers to now earn as they drive therefore saving these transportation companies billions of dollars. This beautiful business model revolutionized the industry by decreasing the overhead cost through decentralization of its operational infrastructure.
With Blockchain, the decentralized technology instead disrupts the financial industry, and many others that serve as middle men of transacting value.
With the application of Bitcoin for example, think of the mining process as a decentralized opportunity for people to connect, verify and validate transactions for the network, in return they are INSTEAD algorithmically rewarded with Bitcoin.
Notice what I just said, the only difference in this disruptive decentralized example is that instead of being rewarded by Uber, a central authority that still costs billions of dollars to operate. Miners are rewarded by the network protocol in which it functions on. It is literally an autonomous incentive structure with the reward of limited, digital coins that can be exchanged for any national currency.
Therefore, resulting in a payment system that costs one tenth of what it costs to operate our current digital payment systems.
Under the hood, this incentive system is very strict in its progression. In other words, the only way for miners to make money at all is to connect, verify and validate the integrity of every transaction. Working for the network in a positive way is really the miner’s only option or else it’s dishonesty or scheming cleverness will instantly be noticed and corrected by millions of other miners in the network.
Let’s say you wanted to work against the other miners, and “hack” the network to let’s say make a false transaction or double spend to somebody.
You would be working against the Blockchain’s progression of the honest miners, the people doing things correctly. Think this is easy? Well… it’s not. These “honest miners” that are moving the network forward, combined, have 100 times the computing power of all of google worldwide. Meaning you better own not just one multimillion dollar super computer, but 100’s of them.
Think of miners as the drivers for Uber. They have their own equipment, resources and time to spend operating the network but earn based on the energy that they produce for the network or in other words the amount of transactions that they verify and validate.
Most Blockchain applications would work in this manner therefore creating a new world of decentralized innovations on the way that we exchange any type of value today.

48,"Originally Answered: What is a blockchain use case?
A blockchain is a public ledger with an important promise: Everybody can verify the ledger autonomously. There is no need for a central entity. You can easily discover on your own whether someone tampered with your copy of the ledger.
And this is all! This is the secret. Repeat after me:
A blockchain is a public ledger verifiable by everybody.
This concept of verifiability by everybody is paramount to a blockchain.
Bitcoin for example uses the ledger to bookkeep all transactions in it. So everybody knows how many coins are on all accounts.
So what are the use cases of a public verifiable ledger?
The scope of all imaginable use cases is really enormous. Whatever you could bookkeep in a public ledger is a use case. I will give you four more examples:
Decentralized DNS (Namecoin). DNS is a ledger bookkeeping domain names.
Trustless public key encryption (i. e. https without these untrustworthy Certificate Authorities)
Ownership records. The ledger bookkeeps the objects and their owners.
Contracts and escrows. The ledger bookkeeps the participants and the wording of the contracts.
Please read this thought-provoking list of use cases which could be implemented using a Bitcoin-style blockchain for a more complete list of use cases. As soon you understand that a blockchain is a ledger you will find many more use cases.
There is still an important element, however.
The ledger is updated continually. Whenever new transactions, DNS entries, records and contracts are entered in the ledger, the data is hashed by an expensive computation. Who does this computation? It is not for free.
Therefore the ledger needs a system in itself to give recognition to the person who provided a hash for a block of entries.
In Bitcoin this system is called mining. Bitcoin miners take a bunch of transactions waiting for verification and calculate a cryptographic hash by an expensive algorithm. In exchange for this service they can keep some bitcoins for themselves. This system is engrained in the bitcoin protocol.
For non-money use cases the blockchain needs to find a way to compensate for calculating the hashes.
Note that this answer doesn't cover all aspects of blockchains, for example what exact algorithms are used and why the calculation of the hash is expensive. I just focused on what use cases a blockchain might have. There is enough stuff on the Internet to explain the nitty-gritty details of Bitcoin and other blockchain implementations.
Addendum
The blockchain being a ledger also points out unfavourable use cases. Bitcoin has trouble to scale to a world currency. Imagine a ledger with billions of entries. Too large and unwieldy.
In principle Bitcoin has shown that the blockchain system works. To overcome the growing pains there are attempts: Retrofit or adapt Bitcoin or introduce a completely different blockchain. I think splitting the ledger corresponding to a criterium (like the address of a payment sender) and use a master blockchain to verify all sub blockchains might be worth a try. Perhaps there is already such a project. The landscape of all different blockchains is diverse and confusing. Bitcoin is still the first and the principal money blockchain or as others would say: cryptocurrency.

Read a few different answers on this Quora thread, as well as watching one of my favorite blockchain Youtube videos below. This is not my channel… I just think this guy did a really great job in breaking it down.
How Does a Blockchain Work? - Simply Explained
Below is my typed explanation of Blockchain Technology.
A lot of people may not realize that blockchain technology is likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades… We may have thought it was social media or even artificial intelligence but In a way I don’t believe it is and here’s why.
Blockchain is the next generation of the internet as we know it… It’s a technology that has many applications and holds vast promise for every business, society and individual person reading this answer.
In order for you to understand Blockchain, I need you to understand how the internet currently operates. So, for the past few decades we have been living in what’s called “The Internet of Information”
When I am sending you a Word document, PowerPoint, Email or text message, I’m not actually sending you the original, I’m sending you a copy...
Which is great! This is democratized information.
But when it comes to financial assets, things like:
Money
Bonds
Futures
Intellectual Property
Energy
Music
Art
Voting
Sending you a copy is a really bad idea… If I’m sending you $100 its pretty important that I don’t still have the money…
This has been called the Double Spend problem by cryptographers for quite a long time. So today, we rely entirely on big intermediaries such as:
Governments
Social Media Companies
Credit Card Companies
Banks
These intermediaries establish trust and certainty with every transaction of value.
These intermediaries perform every type of transactional logic from every kind of commerce from authentication and identification of people, clearing, settling and record keeping.
Overall they do a pretty good job. But there are growing problems…
They are Centralized, therefore creating one point of attack that hackers continue to breach.
A recent example being Equifax, publicly revealing that 143 million identities were stolen from their servers, therefore completing the biggest hack in human history. The old record was set by Home Depot just two years previous where a hacker gained access to over 50 million credit cards in less than a day.
These intermediaries Exclude billions of people from the global economy, for example, people that don’t have access or enough money to have a bank account.
They slow things down… It can take a second for an email to go around the world but it can take weeks for money to move through the banking system across the city, and they take a big piece of the action, 10-20% to send money to a different country.
They capture our data, our privacy is constantly being undermined and the biggest problem is that overall they’ve appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically.
We have wealth creation but growing social inequality.
What if there were not just an internet of information but an internet of value… Some kind of vast, global, distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody.
Where every kind of asset from money to music could be stored, moved, managed and exchanged all without powerful intermediaries. In other words, a native peer-peer medium, but for value. It’s called the Blockchain.
Before we dive into exactly how this innovative “Blockchain” technology works, I want to first dive into its first application, Bitcoin. By doing so, it will give me a chance to examine an actual case study in which this technology has already been implemented. Through this understanding you will be able to imagine ALL of the different possibilities and opportunity that Blockchain has to offer outside of Bitcoin.
So in 2008 the financial industry crashed, shortly after, an unknown person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto created a white paper in which it developed a protocol for a digital cash that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.
This seemingly simple act set off a spark, that… well ignited the world. It either has people excited, terrified or otherwise interested in many places.
All Bitcoin is, is a digital asset that can be bought, sold or exchanged between parties over the internet with little to no transaction fees, instantaneously anywhere in the world. Because of this, Bitcoin can be used to store value just like gold, silver and other types of investments. What makes Bitcoin so unique is unlike those other investments Bitcoin also serves as a digital currency in which you can use to buy products, services as well as make payments and exchange value directly and electronically.
However, different from other types of traditional currencies, such as the USD, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. In other words, it can function as an international medium of value, meaning it is not jurisdictional, or Fiat therefore putting no limits onto its reach. Anyone that can access the web with the most basic of a device can now transact and exchange value internationally.
What a lot of people may or may not realize, is that it is (literally) 10 million times more flexible than our current USD cash system. Most people believe in order to buy Bitcoin they have to buy an entire coin. That is not true… Just like gold, you don’t have to exchange an entire gold bar for a loaf of bread… We have developed a system of cash/notes that break down the value of Gold into increments of one hundreds, fifty’s, twenty’s, tens, fives, singles, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
When buying, selling or exchanging Bitcoin, the minimum or maximum amount that one can exchange hardly exists… Therefore, I do not have to send an entire coin to transact with someone, even if Bitcoin’s price is at $10,000 dollars a coin, you can buy and exchange one dollar’s worth, or even a tenth of a penny’s worth! In fact, how I got the literal “10 million times more flexible” number is that a Bitcoin can actually be broken down into one hundred millionth of a coin. It’s called a Satoshi.
So, when you send Bitcoin to someone or use Bitcoin to buy anything, you don’t need to use a bank, credit card or any other type of third party intermediary. Instead, from your mobile device or computer, you can send Bitcoin directly to another party over the internet and it will arrive securely, almost instantly without being observed, analyzed or charged to the extent of our current digital payment systems. Think of it as the cash of the internet, except instead of physically handing it to someone we can now exchange it at the simplicity level of an email or text message.
So how does this thing actually work? How are these transactions processed, and confirmed and what’s stopping someone from manipulating the transactions, such as hacking the network and sending themselves a million dollars? Is it owned by someone? How does it just “run on its own with Blockchain?”
Bitcoin is running on the Blockchain, for a second I want you to also imagine any other digital asset from music to energy are also ran on the Blockchain. With Blockchain the validity, integrity and transactional information are NOT centralized and controlled by one group, in one place, like a bank or credit card company… but instead posted live to a network that is operated and validated by millions of people called miners.
The case study I like to use to explain who these “miners” are, and how the Bitcoin network functions is, the taxi business. It was once a giant corporation, but with massive restrictions on scalability due to overhead costs of vehicles to provide for drivers. This industry was dramatically disrupted by Uber, a decentralized network of drivers with their own vehicles, time, resources and energy to provide service for the Uber network in exchange for money.
The only job of Uber is now to process, validate and confirm transactions and pick-ups. The system is now set up as a decentralized incentive structure for drivers to now earn as they drive therefore saving these transportation companies billions of dollars. This beautiful business model revolutionized the industry by decreasing the overhead cost through decentralization of its operational infrastructure.
With Blockchain, the decentralized technology instead disrupts the financial industry, and many others that serve as middle men of transacting value.
With the application of Bitcoin for example, think of the mining process as a decentralized opportunity for people to connect, verify and validate transactions for the network, in return they are INSTEAD algorithmically rewarded with Bitcoin.
Notice what I just said, the only difference in this disruptive decentralized example is that instead of being rewarded by Uber, a central authority that still costs billions of dollars to operate. Miners are rewarded by the network protocol in which it functions on. It is literally an autonomous incentive structure with the reward of limited, digital coins that can be exchanged for any national currency.
Therefore, resulting in a payment system that costs one tenth of what it costs to operate our current digital payment systems.
Under the hood, this incentive system is very strict in its progression. In other words, the only way for miners to make money at all is to connect, verify and validate the integrity of every transaction. Working for the network in a positive way is really the miner’s only option or else it’s dishonesty or scheming cleverness will instantly be noticed and corrected by millions of other miners in the network.
Let’s say you wanted to work against the other miners, and “hack” the network to let’s say make a false transaction or double spend to somebody.
You would be working against the Blockchain’s progression of the honest miners, the people doing things correctly. Think this is easy? Well… it’s not.

52,"Originally Answered: In layman's terms, what is ""Blockchain Technology""?
Before we delve directly into blockchain technology, it is important to understand the vital role intermediaries play in the global economy. Intermediaries like banks and governments facilitate the transaction of goods & services by creating trust & certainty.
For example - when an individual or business makes an electronic payment, they require a bank to track & record the transaction. Think about using a credit or debit card to make a purchase from a store. How does the store confirm a customer's credit status? How is the transaction recorded? In this case, third party intermediaries, the seller & customer's bank, approve, track & record the transaction for each party in their private accounts. But intermediaries also play an important role beyond financial services and transactions.
Think about the transfer of information. Think about real estate for example. Who records the change of property ownership & land rights when an individual buys a new home? Where are these records stored? In this case, the transaction records are kept by local government authorities who record all the important information pertaining property ownership, land size and legal rights. If government records didn't exist, how would a home owner prove they own the property? With no repository of trusted records, anyone could potentially claim ownership of anything.
But what if there was a way of making a transaction that didn't require the use of a trusted intermediary? Imagine direct business to business or peer to peer transactions. No banks, no government, no intermediaries of any kind.
Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology creates a decentralised digital public record of transactions that is secure, anonymous, tamper proof & unchangeable. Instead of a bank or other intermediary maintaining a private database of records, blockchain technology makes all records public.
In the blockchain, every time a transaction occurs, a block of data is added to a digital chain. For example, if person (A) transfers money or information to person (B) this transaction will be logged in the blockchain with a certain code. The blockchain creates trust because a complete copy of the chain, which shows every transaction, is held by the entire network. If someone attempts to cheat the system or steal, they can be easily identified.
No Intermediaries - So What?
The elimination of intermediaries brings with it a number of benefits, many of which cannot yet be fully comprehended. Banks & governments for example, often impede the free flow of business because of the time it takes to process transactions and regulatory requirements. The blockchain could enable people and businesses to trade much more frequently and efficiently. This would significantly boost local and international trade. Blockchain technology would also eliminate expensive intermediary fees that have become a large burden on individuals and businesses. Think about the amount of money you spend on bank fees every year. Wouldn't it be great to transfer money at no cost? There are also security benefits. Hacking attacks and fraudulent activities that commonly impact large central intermediaries would not be possible with blockchain technology. These are just some of the potential benefits blockchain technology could deliver. The technology could profoundly disrupt hundreds of industries that rely on intermediaries.

53,"I often hear people say, “I like blockchain but not bitcoin.” One mistake people often make is comparing bitcoin to blockchain because it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison. Bitcoin is the digital token, and blockchain is the ledger that keeps track of who owns the digital tokens. A more accurate comparison is public vs. private blockchains. A public blockchain is open and interoperable, like the internet, and a private blockchain is closed and limits the people who are granted access, like an intranet. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, wrote an excellent blog post explaining the difference between the two types of blockchains (three if you count consortium blockchains). I encourage you to read his post.
Additionally, I’ve outlined a few reasons that bitcoin matters in the context of public blockchains vs. private blockchains. Ultimately, it depends on what you want to accomplish. If you want to transfer money or a digital asset to anyone in the world regardless of the digital wallet a person uses to store assets, then bitcoin is incredibly important, for several reasons.
Bitcoin is the digital token that represents money, or the digital asset, and is transferred from one wallet to another.
Miners are paid in bitcoin to validate transactions and maintain the security of the network. If there are no bitcoins, or bitcoins have no value, miners won’t be paid. If miners aren’t paid, no one will process transactions and secure the ledger. By securing the ledger, miners help enable the decentralization that make the public blockchain open and accessible to anyone who wants to use it.
Mutually distrusting parties are incentivized to record and replicate the most current version of the ledger. Miners who are unaware of the newest version will be wasting resources on extending a shorter chain and are very unlikely to see profits — paid in bitcoin. There are thousands of computers, distributed all over the globe, that actively seek out the most up-to-date copy of the bitcoin ledger. These incentives ensure that longest chain, or ledger, is extremely unlikely to be lost or destroyed, which forms one of the pillars supporting bitcoin’s immutability.
However, if you want to transfer digital assets between a closed group of people, want to maintain privacy of transactions between a closed group of people, or have a high volume of transactions per second, then a private blockchain is needed, and bitcoin will have no relevance.

55,"Imagine explaining digital signatures and proof of work…with babies. I’m going to absolutely mess with this answer, because I am the thousandth person who isn’t Vitalik Buterin trying to explain something that only Vitalik Buterin and Jack Lu really understands.
I am going to hit misconceptions, in the hope that they illustrate why a minority of the world raves on about how Bitcoin and blockchain are about to change the world – while the other 80% of people go, “huh?”
Here’s the first one. I hate this term “double spend problem”.
The problem with the phrase “Bitcoin solves the double spend problem” is…well because Visa does it better. The oft quoted figure is Bitcoin can do 7 transactions per second. Well Visa can peak out at 56k transactions per second. How can this new technology change the world when Visa is beating its ass 800x?
Because blockchain isn’t amazing because of what Bitcoin is, it is amazing because of how blockchain does it.
Blockchain solves the double spend problem by making a digital asset unique.
Image: I’m mostly grabbing these from the Quora search
Visa is a bunch of banks getting together and filling in a big database. When you move money on existing financial tech rails what is really happening is some guy somewhere is saying “I swear on my heart that some money moved from Mumbai and now it is in Moscow. Look, my PC said so.”
That is it - and it does it really well. I mean incredibly well. Your bank has probably been hacked. Bitcoin and Ethereum have had flaws exploited. Yeah fraud on Visa is a massive issue, but they have kept the Russian mafia out of their servers. Visa is good at what they do.
Most databases are a list of balances, or facts. British Airways knows I have 6,000 air miles. My auto insurer knows my drivers license.
Maybe they still have all my old transactions and all my old claims, or maybe they delete the ones from ten years ago. Maybe and who cares.
Bitcoin cares. Instead of recording the balance, they record every transaction. And when you sum all the transactions you get the balance (or UTXO unspent transaction balance).
And every transaction has a digital signature. I’m trying to think of an easy way to explain digital signatures and cryptographic keys, and I’m pretty close to saying there isn’t a way. Here’s the best I can come up with. Imagine my baby always burps 87 seconds after he finishes his bottle. So I hand you my baby to hold and say he’s gonna burp. And he does. No one else can do this trick so you know he’s my baby.
Image: not my baby
I know, I know, terrible example, (he does way more than burp, both ends => same time) but hopefully someone at the back had a laugh, because my jeans are going in the wash.
These digital signatures, that others cannot copy, means we can put all these transactions out there publicly. We can keep my name out of it, yet we can see whatever that digital thing is, through its entire life.
Here’s a crazy story. You may have heard of Silk Road. Sketchy online market where people used to buy drugs. You will have heard how the FBI busted it. But did you know that they also busted two dirty cops who took bribes from Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road?[1] Basically turning Bitcoins into cash stinks a room out as quick as my kid. Bitcoins are pseudo anonymous. They are the perfect complement to online crime. But they are a terrible way to get US dollars or GBP sterling - quite simply you still need the legit financial system and they are checking. We’ll talk more on these on and off ramps further down. But this is another misconception I’m dying to put a nail in. Cash is dirtier than Bitcoin. If you do crime, you want cash. There’s lots of it. People ignore the cocaine its sprinkled with. You can spend it anywhere. Bitcoins are hard to spend in size, even when they’re legit.
I also had another sad discovery: you are liable for tax on Bitcoin gains in both the US and UK. It’s treated as “normal property”.
https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs...
So back to blockchain. Let’s start with this long list of transactions that individuals have proofed as authentically related to them. How does someone add a transaction?
Well you make the transaction and you let it float off into the mempool. That’s just temporary storage. It is up to miners to take it out of there and verify / process transactions into a block. Blocks of transactions are chained, ergo blockchain!
Buterin describes Bitcoin as a first to file system. Somebody puts two transactions out there for the same Bitcoin, whichever receiver gets their transaction processed first gets the money. The other person gets a burn.
The formation of blocks is more interesting than it seems. You wanna hear something crazy, your iphone can probably process as many transactions as Bitcoin. If a blockchain network has one node, then the difficulty is set to zero and it just does it. 7 transactions are not tough.
But this is blockchain. Blockchain doesn’t want one iphone or one Visa or one Zions Bank processing the transactions. It wants millions. It wants legit superheroes like Elon Musk and Jennifer Lawrence processing transactions, as well as low down crooks like they guys pretending to run your country and mine.
And so they make processing costly.
Here’s a question, can I explain proof of work with a farting baby? No, of course I can’t.
Image: winner winner, chicken dinner
It’s a math problem. But I can do it with a baby race. Imagine ten couples with their babies. Some babies are bigger than the others. They gotta be the favorite. But babies are random. Some will chill out half way along because they want to eat some bug in the grass. Others will burst out crying before they cross the start line.
Whichever couple has the strongest baby will probably win. But its random so even the slowest one will win sometimes.
Now replace baby with computing power and you got proof of work. It’s a random math game. And this is again more interesting than it seems. If this were adults Usain Bold would always win. They made a system where the guy with the biggest PC doesn’t always win.
Miners run this baby race, and if their baby wins, they get a prize. They also get to process some transactions too, but the prizes are what they are really after. Their rewards are going through the roof.
Image: blockchain.info
A big chunk of that is because the price of their Bitcoin rewards are going up. But they’re also getting more outside of that. I ran the numbers and it used to be that if transactions went up 100%, miner rev would go up 8%. A few months ago if transactions went up 100%, miner rev went up 55%. It’s probably even more than that now. The miners are squeezing up the rents on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Every transaction takes up space. A few bytes here and a few bytes there. There’s a Max Block Size limit specified in blockchain, that states how much data is allowed in one block. The basics of blockchain processing capacity is blocksize multiplied by time between blocks. And this is the why we have Bitcoin cash and endless arguments about blocksize.
I don’t have a good baby analogy for this so I’m going to keep on walking along. The main point is that blockchain is resource hungry by design. As it stands, one iphone can do 7 transactions a second and all the supercomputers in the world would do 7 transactions a second.
Don’t get hung up on the 7 transactions, it’s a technical decision with a lot of flex. It isn’t even strictly accurate. But the premise is the same, more compute on the network, higher difficultly, same amount of output at the end.
This costliness is how you allow malicious actors on your network. If they attack your network they have to expend all this cost, or maybe 51% of it. And every time the thing you want to change goes further back, you gotta blitz this cost for longer and longer.
Image: Not an optical illusion
Here is the consensus engine: whichever chain is longer (more blocks) is reality. Whichever chain is shorter is fiction.
I get a little hung up on the term immutable. Arguably it’s a good example of the multi-sided nature of blockchain. Once a transaction is on the chain, there is no amend functionality. However, its technically possible for another chain to emerge as the longest chain and delete the other one. That doesn’t feel immutable to me. But suffice to say blockchain is change resistant.
Now let’s move on to Bitcoin believers versus Bitcoin haters.
#hodlhodlhodl! Bitcoin believers think it will replace the dollar. I’ve put my answer to that deep in here.
https://www.quora.com/If-you-inv...
Bitcoin haters see a bubble, they see no fundamentals, they see a Ponzi scheme.
Me I’m a Bitcoin tourist. Bitcoin is a bubble, but it is not the bubble where the real price is zero in my opinion. Personally, I think it could be worth the current price at the tail end of my lifetime. Perhaps it’ll drop to sub $1k on its way there. Maybe it’ll get to $100k before then.
The way I look at Bitcoin: imagine you are super rich. Like Scrooge McDuck. You hire a bunch of lawyers and you set up a trust in the Bahamas and a corporate entity in Delaware and basically nobody touches your money. You are not evading tax, you are legally avoiding tax and keeping people out of your business. When you spend it you pay sales tax on it, but until then its protected.
That is Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is giving people with modest amounts of savings the opportunity to act like a rich person.
Image: fake it till you make it
Now, many holders of Bitcoin are there for the lottery like opportunity. Hell I’ll put my hand up. But the two sides to the price rise is that yes, the price rise is drawing in lots of new users, but its undoubtedly hurting its practical usage for transactions.[2]
If you want Bitcoin to be a currency you probably want it to stop going up.
I’m going to slip some bad news in here.
Here is ShapeShift, a company that swaps cryptocurrencies, getting caught lying about how they make money. Companies do this all the time, say one thing and make the money elsewhere. [3] But this is blockchain guys, we can look at what you are doing in real time.
When it comes to crypto, for every Vitalik Buterin and Charlie Lee that makes you confident the best people are working in crypto, there are many others that are here to simply exploit as many as they can.
If you want to really see some ugly rumors, you should check out bitfinex’ed on twitter.[4]
I agree with bitfinex’ed that tether are car wash tokens. His dynamite accusation is that the exchange Bitfinex are printing them to gas up the Bitcoin price.
I could just go on and on with this stuff. For example, pump and dump scams are endemic across the cryptocurrency space.[5] Groups of traders coordinate through Telegram and buy small coins, driving up the price dramatically. These moves take on a life of their own as others rush in. And then the original buyers sell out and move on.
This works because so many coins mostly don’t trade. Small trading volumes despite the big market capitalizations.
Crypto really is the Wild West of finance.
Let’s jump to the traditional finance industry. The traditional finance industry is potentially going to implement their own version of blockchain – that looks nothing like blockchain. They will likely drop proof of work and have trusted nodes that they control. They’ll keep the distributed, the crypto, the unique asset aspects. They’ll add on some funky bells and whistles like gmail labels and node specific channels. These guys are gonna adopt blockchain and when they do it will be big.
They won’t adopt Bitcoin, except to sell it as an asset class. The killer problem for them is that the whole business is now about Know Your Customer (KYC). They won’t let you swap Bitcoins into dollars unless you send them your passport.
Does this mean Bitcoin is doomed?
No way. This is the reason why I stick by my line that 1-3 cryptocurrencies are going to be a store of value in the medium term. As long as rich people keep hiring lawyers to set up trusts then there’s a demand for crypto.
Why only one to three?
Image: the Bitcoin of the past
Let’s think about air miles. Air miles are a digital currency. Maybe they suck because you fly United and they put you in fight club last time you went to New York. But air miles also suck because you cannot change them into dollars. Buying air miles with dollars is crazy. A store of value requires that somebody is spending dollars to buy that crypto. If the only buyers of your crypto are Bitcoin holders, then at some future point Bitcoin is the store of value and your little coin is…like…a real business doing what it originally set out to do.
I feel like the intensely tribal behavior of many crypto owners, indicates how most of them know there can only be a few winners too.
These few crypto, they will be the basis of the future alternative finance sector. It will be pseudo anonymous and it will do lots of things that rich people pay for all the time. It will even be advantaged as an ecosystem versus traditional finance because its currency will be part of the coding. Traditional finance looks like it won’t have a native cryptocoin, so basically the money has to move off chain. This is called the cash leg by central bankers. Certainly there is talk on FEDcoin[6] , but I suspect it’ll only be for the banks to use. Frankly, governments like the fact that banks can print money…and once you got a FEDcoin in the hands of regular Joes, then why would you use a bank?
Here’s my punchline: Crypto hodlers are right that crypto is big and going to get bigger. Sensible naysayers are likely right that ultimately we are going to get an ugly bubble like reckoning. Parallel to that the deployment of blockchain has barely got started.
Just think about all the junk we got that is written on paper or printed on plastic. All of that can now exist digitally and not be copied as easily as the whole of your music collection.
Best of luck everybody.
If you want to read 25 pages on why Bitcoin might be a technological prototyping signal with respect to distributed ledger, here’s the link:
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3198530
This would suggest that maybe the recent down move is driven by a loss of confidence in adoption, but also suggests perhaps we can have another up cycle as adoption hype firms up again.

56,"The blockchain, which runs the Bitcoin network, was never hacked. And there is currently a 100 billion dollar reward - the largest single reward in history - for a hacker to do so.
The technology behind the Bitcoin network has withstood the test of time since 2009. In fact, the integrity of the network is arguably better than bank-level security.
Mike Novogratz, famed billionaire, has hired a cybersecurity expert to attempt to hack it. After failing numerous attempts, he invested 10% of his net worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum and quote “best investment of my life” after soaring as a huge multibagger several months later.
What you’ve heard on the news are misleading headlines - what they really mean by “Bitcoin gets hacked” is that Bitcoin wallets holding Bitcoin get hacked, Bitcoin exchanges holding Bitcoin wallets get hacked. This is similar to businesses getting embezzled and individuals getting their wallets stolen. Human error is to blame. However, the “monetary system” is extremely secure, analogously speaking.
You can independently verify this from the mathematics of the open source code that secures the whole system, enabling a trustless peer to peer network. As someone with a decent Computer Science and cybersecurity background, I can confidently say the code currently makes it “mathematically impossible” to hack.
There are some “theoretical” holes, such as quantum computing (not a working technology), which is theoretically able to “hack” the network, but there are also proposed working fixes that would quickly plug up such flaws in the event that quantum computing is (or close to being) developed, and even the unlikely event such a large scale potential attack happens, there can be “reversible” with a hard fork network consensus. This likely won’t happen in decades, which is why I’m “risking” my money where my mouth is at - into the network.
The individual Bitcoin wallet risk can be mitigated to near zero/mathematically insignificant, only if the individual properly sets up security measures, such as multi-signature wallets, two-factor authentication/cold storage and private key encryption. There are currently quality, free, user-friendly software that allows such Bitcoin wallets to be made conveniently if one can follow a short manual. If you can’t bother to do so, there is the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) founded by the Winklevoss twins (Facebook founders) that allows accredited investors to gain Bitcoin exposure with all the security detailed and insured as per their SEC disclosure documents, or you can use Coinbase (a Silicon Valley company valued at 1B, backed by Andreessen Horowitz) for a small fee to do so on your behalf. Keep in mind, the risk of an exchange getting hacked is non-zero, but relatively low for the largest ones, and that’s a problem of which service provider you trust enough to hold your coins.
Even the biggest “hack of Bitcoin” claimed by the news - exchange (not the blockchain) Mt. Gox - currently has enough embezzled funds in escrow from law enforcement to pay back ALL legal claims if you look here: https://siliconangle.com/blog/20... (this is relatively old news, correct the price of Bitcoin for current float price, and you’ll see what I mean)

57,"What is Blockchain Technology? A Step-by-Step Guide For Beginners
The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchains create the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin, the tech community is now finding other potential uses for the technology.
Bitcoin has been called “digital gold”, and for good reason. To date, the total value of currency is close to $9 billion US. And blockchains can make other types of digital value. Like the internet (or your car), you don’t need to know how the blockchain works to use it. However, having a basic knowledge of this new technology shows why it’s considered revolutionary.
“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”
Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)
A distributed database
Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain.
 
Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared — and continually reconciled — database. This is a way of using the network that has obvious benefits. The blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.
 
To go in deeper with the google spreadsheet analogy I would like you to read this piece from a blockchain specialist.
What is Blockchain Technology? A Step-by-Step Guide For Beginners
Blockchain as Google Docs
“The traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient, and ask them to make revisions to it. The problem with that scenario is that you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes, because you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it. That’s how databases work today. Two owners can’t be messing with the same record at once.That’s how banks maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again).
With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is a shared document. The distributed part comes into play when sharing involves a number of people.
Imagine the number of legal documents that should be used that way. Instead of passing them to each other, losing track of versions, and not being in sync with the other version, why can’t *all* business documents become shared instead of transferred back and forth? So many types of legal contracts would be ideal for that kind of workflow.
You don’t need a blockchain to share documents, but the shared documents analogy is a powerful one.”
William Mougayar, Venture advisor, 4x entrepreneur, marketer, strategist and
blockchain specialist
Durability and robustness
Blockchain technology is like the internet in that it has a built-in robustness. By storing blocks of information that are identical across its network, the blockchain cannot:
Be controlled by any single entity.
Has no single point of failure.
Bitcoin was invented in 2008. Since that time, the Bitcoin blockchain has operated without significant disruption. (To date, any of problems associated with Bitcoin have been due to hacking or mismanagement. In other words, these problems come from bad intention and human error, not flaws in the underlying concepts.)
The internet itself has proven to be durable for almost 30 years. It’s a track record that bodes well for blockchain technology as it continues to be developed.
What is Blockchain Technology? A Step-by-Step Guide For Beginners
Transparent and incorruptible
The blockchain network lives in a state of consensus, one that automatically checks in with itself every ten minutes. A kind of self-auditing ecosystem of digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten minute intervals. Each group of these transactions is referred to as a “block”. Two important properties result from this:
Transparency
data is embedded within network as a whole, by definition it is public.
It cannot be corrupted
altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.
In theory, this could be possible. In practice, it’s unlikely to happen. Taking control of the system to capture Bitcoins, for instance, would also have the effect of destroying their value.
“Blockchain solves the problem of manipulation. When I speak about it in the West, people say they trust Google, Facebook, or their banks. But the rest of the world doesn’t trust organizations and corporations that much — I mean Africa, India, the Eastern Europe, or Russia. It’s not about the places where people are really rich. Blockchain’s opportunities are the highest in the countries that haven’t reached that level yet.”
Vitalik Buterin, inventor of Ethereum
A network of nodes
A network of so-called computing “nodes” make up the blockchain.
Node
(computer connected to the blockchain network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the blockchain network.
Together they create a powerful second-level network, a wholly different vision for how the internet can function.
Every node is an “administrator” of the blockchain, and joins the network voluntarily (in this sense, the network is decentralized). However, each one has an incentive for participating on the network: the chance of winning Bitcoins.
Nodes are said to be “mining” Bitcoin, but the term is something of a misnomer. In fact, each one is competing to win Bitcoins by solving computational puzzles. Bitcoin was the raison d’etre of the blockchain as it was originally conceived. It’s now recognized to be only the first of many potential applications of the technology.
There are an estimated 700 Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies (exchangeable value tokens) already available. As well, a range of other potential adaptations of the original blockchain concept are currently active, or in development.
“Bitcoin has the same character a fax machine had. A single fax machine is a doorstop. A world where everyone has a fax machine is an immensely valuable thing.”
Larry Summers, Former US Secretary of the Treasury
The idea of decentralization
By design, the blockchain is a decentralized technology.
Anything that happens on it is a function of the network as a whole. Some important implications stem from this. By creating a new way to verify transactions aspects of traditional commerce could become unnecessary. Stock market trades become almost simultaneous on the blockchain, for instance — or it could make types of record keeping, like a land registry, fully public. And decentralization is already a reality.
A global network of computers use blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The forms of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.
“I think decentralized networks will be the next huge wave in technology.”
Melanie Swan, author Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy (2015)
Who will use the blockchain?
As web infrastructure, you don’t need to know about the blockchain for it to be useful in your life.
Currently, finance offers the strongest use cases for the technology. International remittances, for instance. The World Bank estimates that over $430 billion US in money transfers were sent in 2015.
The blockchain potentially cuts out the middleman for these types of transactions. Personal computing became accessible to the general public with the invention of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which took the form of a “desktop”. Similarly, the most common GUI devised for the blockchain are the so-called “wallet” applications, which people use to buy things with Bitcoin, and store it along with other cryptocurrencies.
Transactions online are closely connected to the processes of identity verification. It is easy to imagine that wallet apps will transform in the coming years to include other types of identity management.
“Online identity and reputation will be decentralized. We will own the data that belongs to us.”
William Mougayar, author The Business Blockchain: Promise, Practice, and Application of the Next Internet Technology (2016)
Enhanced security
By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.
Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit. Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the “username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use encryption technology.
The basis for this are the so-called public and private “keys”. A “public key” (a long, randomly-generated string of numbers) is a users’ address on the blockchain. Bitcoins sent across the network gets recorded as belonging to that address. The “private key” is like a password that gives its owner access to their Bitcoin or other digital assets. Store your data on the blockchain and it is incorruptible. This is true, although protecting your digital assets will also require safeguarding of your private key by printing it out, creating what’s referred to as a paper wallet.

58,"Currently decentralized blockchain applications have few options to store data. Decentralized storage options are:
Storing everything in blockchain itself
Peer to peer file system, such as IPFS
Decentralized cloud file storages, such as Storj, Sia, Ethereum Swarm, etc.
Distributed Databases, such as Apache Cassandra, Rethink DB, etc.
BigChainDB
Ties DB
Let’s consider them all in detail:
Storing everything in blockchain itself: Storing everything in blockchain is the simplest solution. Currently most of the simple decentralized applications work exactly this way. However, this approach has significant drawbacks. First of all transactions to blockchain are slow to confirm. It may seem to be fast for money transfer (anyone can wait a minute), but it is extremely slow for a rich application data flow. Rich application may require many thousands transactions per second. Secondly, it is immutable. The immutability is the strength of blockchain that gives it high robustness but it is a weakness for a data storage. User may change their profile or replace their photo, still all the previous data will sit in blockchain forever and can be seen by anyone. The immutability results in one more drawback - the capacity. If all the applications would keep their data in blockchain, the blockchain size will grow rapidly, exceeding publicly available hard drive capacity. Full nodes can require special hardware. It may result in dangerous centralization of blockchain. That’s why storing data in blockchain only is not a good option for a rich decentralized application.
Peer to peer file system, such as InterPlanetary File System. IPFS allows to share files on client computers and unites them in the global file system. The technology is based on BitTorrent protocol and Distributed Hash Table. There are several good moments. It is really peer to peer - to share anything first put it on your own computer. It will be downloaded only if anyone needs it. It is content addressable, so it is impossible to forge content by the given address. Popular files can be downloaded very quickly thanks to BitTorrent protocol. However it also has some drawbacks. You should stay online if you want to share your files. At least before someone becomes interested and wants to download them from you. It serves only static files, they can not be modified or removed once uploaded. And of course you can not search these files by their meaningful content.
Decentralized cloud file storages: There are also decentralized cloud file storages that lift some of IPFS limitations. From the user’s point of view these storages are just cloud storages like Dropbox, for example. The difference is that the content is hosted on user’s computers who offer their hard drive space for rent, rather than in datacenters. There are plenty of such projects nowadays. For example, Sia, Storj, Ethereum Swarm. You don’t need to stay online to share your files anymore. Just upload the file and it is available in the cloud. These storages are highly reliable, fast enough, have enormous capacity. Still they serve static files only, no content search anyway and, since they are built on the rented hardware, they are not free.
Distributed Databases: Since we need to store structured data and seek for advanced query capabilities we may look at the distributed noSql databases. Why noSql? Because strict transactional SQL databases can not be truly distributed due to the restrictions of the CAP-theorem. To make a database distributed we must sacrifice either consistency or availability. NoSQL databases choose availability over consistency replacing it with so called “eventual consistency” where all the database nodes in the network become consistent some time later. There are many mature realizations of such databases, for example MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, RethinkDB and so on. They are very good - fast, scalable, fault tolerant, support rich query language but still have fatal drawback for our application. They are not Byzantine-proof. All the nodes of the cluster fully trust each other. So any malicious node can destroy the whole database.
BigChainDB: There is another project called BigChainDB that claims to solve the data storage and transaction speed problem. It is also a blockchain but with enormous data capacity and really fast transactions. Let us see how it is possible. BigChainDB is build upon RethinkDB cluster, I mentioned this NoSQL database on the previous slide. BigChainDB uses it to store all the blocks and transactions. That is why it shows such a high throughput - it is the one of the underlying noSQL database. All the BigChainDB nodes (denoted BDB on the slide) are connected to the cluster and have full write access to the database. Here comes a problem - the whole BigChainDB is not byzantine-proof! Any malicious BDB node can destroy the RethinkDB cluster. The BigChainDB team is aware of this problem and promises to solve it sometime in the future, however it is the corner stone of the architecture and changing it may not be possible.Anyway, BigChainDB may be good for a private blockchain. But in my opinion, to avoid confusion it should have been named BigPrivateBlockchain. It is not an option for a public storage.
Ties DB: The currently available options could be a good public database. The closest to the ideal are the noSql databases. The only thing they lack is byzantine fault tolerance. The Ties.Network Database: ties.network is a deep modification of the Cassandra database and offers a preferable solution: The TiesDB inherits the majority of features from the underlying noSQL databases and adds byzantine fault tolerance and incentives. With these features it can become a public database and enable feature-rich applications on Ethereum and other blockchains with smart contracts. The database is writable by any user. But the users are identified by their public key and all the requests are signed. Once created, record remembers its creator who becomes an owner of the record. After that the record can be modified only by the owner. Everyone can read all records, because the database is public. All the permissions are checked on request and replication. Additional permissions can be managed via a smart contract.

59,"Someone eventually realized most people don’t actually care about anything blockchain has to offer.
So, new genius plan: Let’s use the blockchain to function as an escrow.
This is where ‘smart contracts’ came into play.
The idea is fairly simple, and even makes sense on the surface. Both parties put up money, computer code decides where and when it goes. Easy enough.
Unfortunately, like all ideas championed by the crypto enthusiasts, it falls apart once you actually start trying to apply it to the real world.
For instance, let’s say you try to write a smart contract to sort out payment for delivery. Let’s stop those pesky UPS people from giving us their ‘failed to deliver’ notices!
Okay, so the outline is simple.
Step 1: UPS delivers package.
Step 2: UPS does something that proves it delivered the package.
Step 3: The smart contract automatically gives them money.
On the surface, simple. It’s actually automating and accomplishing Step 2 that is the issue, and it’s one that gets handwaved as ‘it’ll get solved, somehow’.
For instance, does a UPS driver click a button that says he did it? That’s not safe; what if he lies?
Does a UPS driver take a geotagged photo of the package? That’s not safe; what if he just picks it up again and leaves? What if he changes the metadata on the photo? What if he just drives by the apartment building, or just leaves it in the lobby?
These tiny little details are not irrelevant. These tiny little details are why we have contract law, and why lawyers get involved.
This assumes there are no flaws in the smart contract. There’s a cryptocurrency game I saw once that plays—not entirely unlike a penny auction. Someone figured out how to fool the smart contract that runs it into giving them a bunch of free money. There’s nothing that can be done about it, because once you prove someone can modify the smart contract, you either trust them or you do not. If you trust them, you don’t need a smart contract. If you don’t trust them, then you no longer trust the smart contract.
There’s a crypto currency, PRL or some such. One of their devs, ostensibly, (though let’s be honest, the dev team just wanted to exit scam their customers), abused a small loophole in the smart contract to award himself a ton of free coins, which he liquidated on the market. Nothing can be done about this, because it is cryptocurrency.
The solution to this, of course, is to hire programmers and lawyers to go over every line of code in the smart contract. But at the point you do that, now you need middlemen.
Remember, you’re going to need someone to code these smart contracts up for you, since most businesses won’t trust each other to code it—whoops, you need middlemen again.
It’s people trying to solve social problems with technology, and it’s never worked.

Near infinite scalability. That means they are able to process at least millions of transactions per second and possibly also billions.
Near infinite decentralisation. This means that their voting should be distributed over at least 10,000 to 100,000 different voters.

That means, they CANNOT be PoW, because PoW suffers from strong mining pool centralization, so the coting is pretty muchc distributed across only 3 voters. They cannot be PoS, because PoS suffers from strong centralization of voting power among the rich, large companies, institutions, governments, thus defeating the whole point of the blockchain. They can also not be dPoS, because dPoS is only distributed across a few dozen nodes.
Permissionlessness and trustlessness. Permissionless means that there is no 3rd party making rules how to vote, thus giving permission. Trustlessness means that nodes do not need to trust each other in order to participate in the voting. This is not given for Ripple, Stellar, EOS, NEO, Ark, Lisk. They are all permissioned and non-trustless, which always leads to cartel formation, lobbyism and introduces a myriad of social engineering attack vectors such as blackmail, coercion, threats etc.
Near instant transactions. That means, that transactions should be confirmed within 3 seconds maximum. 10 seconds is already too much. Imagine, every person needs to wait 10 seconds at the register for the payment to confirm. This would add much overhead and a lot of lost revenue to any retailer or super market.
Low energy usage. Currently with around 50M users, Bitcoin uses 30TWh per year, around the electricity of a small country like Ireland. All banks together use around 100 TWh per year. With 5B users, Bitcoin would use 3,000 TWh per year, 300 times more than all banks combined, making it completely unusable as a global currency. The Bitcoin vs Visa Electricity Consumption Fallacy. This automatically disqualifies all PoW coins (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Verge)
Zero Fees. Having fees is still suboptimal, but it is not such a big point compared to the above 5
Even, the first 3 characteristics are only offered by IOTA, Cardano, Elastos, Nano & Skycoin, the other 3 are the cherries on top. Ethereum also has a good chance to be in this group with their coming implementation of Casper, Raiden, Plasma and Sharding.
Now, you’re asking, what will their market caps be?
Currently we have
Ethereum at $47B
Cardano a $4.5B
IOTA at $2.7B
Nano at $322M
Elastos at $90M
Skycoin at $60M
All of them have the technology to replace Bitcoin. In fact, these 5 are the only ones that would be able to replace Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is currently at a $132B market cap and will also most likely go back to $20,000 or a market cap of $400B before these altcoins start overtaking it.
That means that these altcoins also will reach a $400B market cap and possibly more in the next bull run, which is probably coming end of 2018 or early 2019. A $1T market cap of the replacement of Bitcoin is definitely possibly within the next year.
This would lead to the following investment returns.
Ethereum from $47B to $1T = 21x
Cardano from $4.5B to $1T = 222x
IOTA from $2.7B to $1T = 370x
Nano from $322M to $1T = 3,150x
Elastos from $90M to $1T = 11,111x
Skycoin from $60M to $1T = 16,666x
However, in reality, the number one spot will probably be shared by at least 3 of these coins, so that the market caps will be something like this
Ethereum from $47B to $300B = 7x
Cardano from $4.5B to $300B = 70x
IOTA from $2.7B to $300B = 108x
Nano from $322M to $300B = 920x
Elastos from $90M to $300B = 3,000x
Skycoin from $60M to $100B = 1,666x
From these 6, I don’t think Nano will be among this group. They do have the technology, but their platform doesn’t offer any of the features that the others offer, such as Smart Contracts, Dapps, ICO launch platform and more. These are very essential in the crypto sphere currently and without them, it’s unlikely to be able to compete for the number 1 spot.
Furthermore, Skycoin will also take longer to achieve this level, since they want to completely replace ISPs and this simply takes time.
As for Etheruem, Cardano, IOTA, Elastos, they all seem to have the same chances. Ethereum, Cardano, Elastos compete for the very same, being the best dapps platform. It seems that Elastos offers the most comprehensive dapp runtime environment, followed closely by Cardano. Ethereum isn’t there yet with its technology, though they have an advantage in terms of branding, awareness and adoption already.
IOTA comes from a different angle. They do not offer dapps yet, but they have a very fast and unique technology with their Tangle, which is the fastest among all the below 4 platforms.
In terms of investing, I would allocate funds this way
10% into Ethereum from $47B to $300B = 7x
10% into Cardano from $4.5B to $300B = 70x
40% into IOTA from $2.7B to $300B = 108x
40% into Elastos from $90M to $300B = 3,000x

Judging by the not-so-vast history of the crypto market, it seems right for me to dissuade you from going ahead and selling your Ether. After all, the market has suffered such shocks in the past, only for it to recover and become bearish yet again. So, provided you have the patience to buy and hold, I’d recommend you NOT to sell your Ether.

>>>PARTICIPATE IN THE BEST ICO OF MAY 2018!
Feasible Overall Environment
Even though the media tries to portray a doom-mongering scenario for the crypto market every day, the events of the last few months have been hugely positive for the crypto market. And I’m not talking about one or two solitary events, rather, there are three events of the recent past which have paved the way for crypto to replace money in the coming years.
The first and the most important event was the declaration by the head of US Commodity and Trade Finance Commission’s head regarding the regulation of the crypto market. Remember, this is the body which is tasked with regulating the crypto market. So, if it overplays its hand, it has every tool in its bag to strangulate the whole crypto market in its infancy.
Will it do that? Not if you read the recent statements of CFTC’s head, in which he has described that his commission will take a ‘’DO NO HARM’’ approach towards regulating the crypto market. It means that while they would not leave the crypto market untouched, they won’t over-regulate it, either.
The next two events happened in a space of just over a month. The first of these events was the decision by Venezuelan Government to launch their own cryptocurrency. The second was the decision of the Iranian government to do the same.
Both these events reflect what the media would never tell you: that the world governments are taking crypto seriously. It’s as if they have seen the potential of crypto, and are now desperate to make their move before someone else’s does.
As a result of these events, both of which showcase the trust of world governments in the crypto market, the trust of normal people in the crypto market would improve. This, in turn, would make the market more stable, which means that prices of various cryptocurrencies might rise.
Recovery of the Market
It doesn’t matter which cryptocurrency you decide to look at, every one of them is getting back on track. Since this question is related only to Ethereum, I’d restrict my examples to the same.
For example, the whole crypto market was at its lowest ebb in November when one Ether was worth only $289. Today, however, times have changed for the good, for one Ether costs just under $700 at the time of writing an answer to this question.
And it isn’t only Ether which has displayed resilience to bounce back – for that might mean to some that the reversal is short-lived. Instead, the likes of Bitcoin and even Litecoin are gearing up to make some profits for their investors.
To cite just one example, the value of one Bitcoin was hovering above $8,000 as early as last month. Today, however, its value is over $9,300, which means more than $1,000 in gains in just under a month.
Therefore, in the light of these examples, I’d suggest not selling your Ether. Instead, if I were you, I’d have held it, and waited for the market to get even better before selling it to make some considerable profit.
Cautionary Note: Mine Isn’t An Investment Strategy
Some people treat whatever is written on the Internet as gospel. Thankfully, I’m NOT one of them, and I don’t expect you to be as well.
Yes, everything that I have written above is facts – you can check the links provided to judge the veracity of my claims as well – but if there’s one thing all crypto watchers could agree on; it’s the FACT that the crypto market is impossible to predict.
Therefore, I once again urge you to do your research, consult experts and think hard and low before investing your money – or holding it – in any cryptocurrency.

65,"Hi there,
In order to answer your question best, I would say that we have to set some ground rules on what your background is, because this will have a very direct impact on how you can start a career in blockchain technology or the crypto industry in general.
I would say that based on your background, education and special skills today, there there are 3 ways you can start a career in Blockchain.
1: Technological Background
This category of jobs has been exploding in the last 18 months and you have probably guessed correctly that it is mostly related to engineering jobs:
Back-End Developers
Front-End Developers
UX/UI Designers
Blockchain Developers
Cloud Architects
Test Engineers
iOS / Android Developers
Quality Engineers
Security Engineers
It is safe to say that demand for such workers is only going to grow in the next few years, as it has been exploding in the last months or so. It is a great niche to explore if you want to get quickly into a high-earning job. The best part about it is that if you already know some of the core blockchain development languages like C++ or Solidity (Ethereum) you can get in very easy - most of the information you need is freely accessible in countless tutorials on Youtube, Udemy and so on.
That is to say, you don’t have to work as a Blockchain Developer by default. As long as you have software development skills, you can just transition to a blockchain business as an engineering. Most of these businesses run web applications or mobile applications on top of the Blockchain Stack, so they still need “normal” engineers that are not necessarily busy with coding consensus algorithms.
Here you can browse some Engineering opportunities.
2: Any non-tech specialized background (Marketing, Design, Finance, Legal, Product, Consulting)
There are multiple roles in this “non-tech” category that you can start woking in today, given that you have the required education and experience. Companies and Startups in Blockchain are hiring a lot of people in the so-called traditional job categories today and it is not a bad start. Let’s look at some of the most common categories:
Marketing / PR / Social Media
Every business needs to promote itself. The more blockchain companies reach growth phase (Kraken, Coinbase, r3, Gemini to name a few), the more they will hire people to drive traffic to their products. This category is going to grow a lot. Examples of Blockchain jobs in Marketing.
Sales and Business Development
Same as above - when you have a product, someone has to sell it. Lot’s of hiring in this category too.
Finance
Even startups and growing companies need a financial department, so demand here is going to grow too.
Legal
This is a job category that will only grow more with Crypto becoming more regulated and going out of the “dark” times. Some demand already.
Product Management
Building blockchain products requires great product managers that execute the vision of the founders into requirements and specifications and translate them to the development team. In my personal opinion, this is a very exciting job to be into right now (and the next 5 years for sure).
Consulting
Enterprise Blockchain is not just a marketing word - there are tons of large companies trying to tap into this market, wether it is good or bad it is another topic. The Big4 (Deloitte, PWC, KPMG, EY) are already hiring like crazy for Blockchain Consultants, but also companies like R3 and Ripple have opportunities for consultants.
3: Non-tech generalized background (or no special skills)
Now the best news - you can get into Blockchain even if you have no special education or programming knowledge. How do you ask? Well, you can work in one of the new roles that this industry has created:
Community Managers
Crypto and Blockchain is a very community driven industry. Companies invest heavily in individuals that help them grow their community, be that the community of DEVs supporting the project or the users of the product. This is a very interesting role that does not really require a special qualification and it is a good way of getting into the industry. You will get to meet influencers, talk to consumers, promote a product, setup online communities, travelling around the world to promote the company and so on. A lot of these jobs are also remote, which I guess is what makes them the best job for a young person right now and it has a lot of potential.
Browse Blockchain Community Management jobs here:
Customer Services
Never underestimate CS as an opportunity to enter an industry. You will get to learn the basics of the industry, how the product works, how consumers interact with it, how revenues are formed and how a whole company works. In order to work in Customer Services today, you need to have good language skills and basic technical knowledge of Internet. It is safe to say that these requirements are filled by most of the 20-somethings today that know how to operate a laptop. Again, a lot of these jobs can be remote, so it is a great opportunity to make a living while travelling.
Browse Blockchain Customer Services jobs
Last but not least, there is always the forth option - to start your own company alone or with a co-founder. Then you will have to do a little bit of all of all :)

67,"I think the real question from the OP should read: ""Why would the blockchain be a problem with BTC?"" Bitcoin, being one of the original cryptocurrencies that literally put every-other cryptocurrency on the map transacts on its own blockchain, just as Ethereum does just as EOS does and just as other alt-coins who utilize other core/major cryptocurrencies ecosystem/platform. Also, as Abhishek has stated:
""Bitcoin blockchain nodes are majorly of two types:
1) Full nodes
2) Lightweight or partial nodes
A full node stores the complete blockchain ledger locally. Here, the size of the blockchain is a problem because the full node will have to store all the transactions that ever happened on the blockchain.
The lightweight nodes or partial nodes don’t store the complete ledger. Instead they use a simplified payment verification (SPV) mode which only requires them to download a part of the blockchain. They will connect to full node clients and use bloom filters to ensure that they only receive transactions which are necessary and relevant to their operation.
So, for them, size is not a problem because they don’t have to store a huge amount of data.""
Now adays, more people looking to create decentralized applications are looking into EOS. Certainly there is a lot of opportunity for blockchain developers looking to make DApps and more and more are flocking to EOS's more robust, effecient and functional decentralized platform over BTC's and even Ethereum. With that being said, stable coins are something else to consider. Stable coins are cryptocurencies backed by real-world assets. Real estate, FIAT currency, and other assets that can be liquidated pretty quickly. I really like what I see this company, QuantmRE doing with their approach to bridge the gap between real estate and blockchain. You can check them out if you feel so inclined, but know they're not the only ones are are utilizing stable coins - both IBM and most recently Gemini has embraced and adopted the idea of stable coins for their own use.

69,"Right now, they're both at a discount amidst this bearish market so if you can afford to buy some go for it! With that being said, I'd be more keen to buy Bitcoin over ETH. If you're looking for an alternative to ETH because maybe you lost faith in where they're headed, or just want to experience what a huge upswing in price can be like, I would consider: EOS, or QuantmRE's coin that is coming out soon. EOS has essentially solved many of ETH's shortcomings through its decentralized network and more effecient platform it makes available to blockchain developers. For those looking to build decentralized applications (DApps) many have flocked to EOS in lieu of ETH given its improved network capacity and structure.
In the case of QuantmRE, they may be doing something even more exciting than EOS (in a different way). Unlike EOS, QuantmRE's token (EQRE) is a stable coin. What does that mean? It means it's backed by real world assets, in their case - real estate. What they're aiming o do is bridge the gap between real estate and blockchain and tap into a $200-trillion market and helping homeowners who want to liquidate some of the equity in their home WITHOUT having to take on additional debt through traditional HELOC's or 2nd mortages. For real estate investors, it may be even more exciting as for the first time ever you'll be able to acquire percentages of equity in different properties for as much as you can afford, instead of only having the ability to purchase the entirety of a propety usually with a high barrier to entry most never get to partake in. IBM and Gemini are two other companies who are utilizing stable coins for their own enterprise related efforts, and to protect retail investors from the market volatility cryptocurrency experiences regularly by backing their ""Gemini Dollar"" at a 1:1 ratio against the USD. This effort came after many questioned USDT (Tether) of allegedly issuing out more USDT than they even had the ability to issue.
In any event, I hope this is helpful in making a decision on what cryptocurrency you want to invest in, upvote if so :)

70,"The biggest limitation of Bitcoin is glaringly obvious, but I would like to provide some context first.
Bitcoin saw their first spectacular rise in and around Nov-Dec 2013 when it first reached 1000$. By the end of 2014, Bitcoin had stabilized and was trading at a comfortable 250–350$ range. This was also the period when people were becoming more and more interested and a buzz around Bitcoin was consuming a larger audience than it’s niche. Higher audience led to more scrutiny and experts looked under the hood of Bitcoin.
By 2015, Bitcoin wasn’t a niche anymore. Technical analysis revealed that Bitcoin was suffering from a massive scalibility problem. A problem none of the trading markets, stock managers or your portfolio handlers wanted you to know about, let alone worry about it. Take a look at some of these headlines,
And this article,
By the beginning of 2016 Bitcoins transactions were already slow enough to be frustrating.
———————————————————————————————————
———————————————————————————————————
And mind you, this wasn’t a currency which was being used in form of a debit/credit card to pay for your daily groceries or Pizza. This was a currency only being transferred on it’s trading platforms. At a rate of 1 Transaction per second. Visa supports 2000 - 1000 tps.
Mike Hearn was one of the developers in the core Bitcoin network. He wrote a blog, “Resolution of the Bitcoin experiment”[1] where he talks in detail about the major drawbacks of the Bitcoin. Just take a look at this excerpt from his post,
———————————————————————————————————
———————————————————————————————————
I would suggest going through his blog to get the real picture. But since this blog was written in 2016, I shall continue.
Now, in 2017 the problem is real. Some more article snippets to add to the context.
———————————————————————————————————
———————————————————————————————————
Such articles/blogs/posts or some variant of them are present on each and every coin exchange website. To improve this, Bitcoin promised segwitz, an improvement that was supposed to make transactions faster. But that failed miserably too.
—————————————————————————————-
In one of these cases, a Bitcoiner paid 60$ as transaction fees for one transaction and at the end of 3 days, it was still not confirmed. Some users even had to suffer through a wait time for weeks.
Imagine a real world scenario, where you order a pizza using your Bitcoin wallet. It is entirely possible that you end up paying 60 $ as the transaction fees to buy a 10 $ pizza. If you are lucky, then 3 days after the payment, a confirmation will be sent to the pizza guy and you’ll get your pizza in 3 days and 30 mins. That’s a hell lot of wait for a pizza, don’t you think?
So, scalability is a problem. But why are the transaction fees so high and volatile?
Bitcoin blockchain is designed in a way that the miners gain incentive by mining your block. This technical mumbo-jumbo means that someone gets paid when you make a transaction. And that someone is paid by you. So it is obvious that such a person would prefer finishing those transactions which pay him more than other transactions. That’s why the transaction fees are higher. People pay more so that their transactions can be processed. You can very easily notice the problem in this design. It is possible that a transaction with very low fees, may never get confirmed.
But the biggest problems of all is that the people who manage Bitcoin are not doing anything about it.
Bitcoin is not managed by a formal institution but by a group of people with different opinions. And they aren’t able to make a consensus about improving it. There was a open civil war going on between the core developers back in 2016 which resulted in a Bitcoin fork. People who decided to improve Bitcoin, forked the original and created a new currency. They were shunned by some in Bitcoin community.
There are some more, but I think this answer is long enough as it is. :)

72,"First of all let’s see what Cardano does:
Cardano is a blockchain protocol that is aiming to improve smart contracts and decentralised apps (DApps) in a scalable and a cheap way.
The projects is being led by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson who is trying to solve the problems that Ethereum has.
They are using the proof of stake protocol - which is much faster and scalable.
The protocol is desgined to protect privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators - They are the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.
They are making smart contracts smarter increasing the computation power for a certain contract - Their Network will be able to run bigger algorithms on a DApp without clogging the system.
The thing is that for Ethereum is pretty hard to implement this changes because it’s already up and running - It’s like changing the engine of a machine that is constantly moving.
Cardano’s advantage is that they had time to acknowledge the problems and solve the issues in their own way.
But don’t worry, Ethereum developers are constantly working on improving the network by implementing only great ideas like the Raiden Network which will be up and running by the end of 2018. - Faster and cheaper transactions which would lead to mass adoption.
So to answer your question, Yes, Ethereum is capable of adopting and implementing the best technologies to help it spread in ordinary people’s lifes.

76,"By using the term “Ripple/XRP”, it’s not clear if you’re talking about the company, the digital asset, or both. I’m going to answer for both and use the term “Ripple” to refer to the company and “XRP” to refer to the digital asset.
Ripple’s payment system uses distributed ledger technology and a version of the interledger protocol to process payments between financial institutions. Ripple has announced that over 100 financial institutions are using, or have signed production contracts to use, this network.
XRP is a digital asset based on a blockchain usually called the “XRP Ledger”. It has many characteristics in common with bitcoin. For example, all system state is public, every participant can very that every transaction complies with every rule, and no participant needs to ask anyone else what a transaction did because they execute it themselves.
There are a few key differences between XRP Ledger’s technology and that used by bitcoin. XRP Ledger uses an account model rather than a UTXO model. This means that accounts have properties that you can configure. For example, you can change the private key that signs for an XRP Ledger account without changing its receiving address.
The XRP Ledger also has a built in decentralized exchange that has powerful payment features. For example, a payment can use multiple paths to avoid drawing deeply into an order book. Powerful pathfinding discovers the cheapest payment options.
The main difference, however, is that the XRP Ledger’s method of solving the double spend problem is by using a distributed agreement algorithm rather than proof of work. This has a very significant number of advantages including avoiding the need for users of the network to reach compromises with miners who want high fees. It also allows the network to reach finality on over a thousand transactions per second in roughly five seconds.
It also preserves freedom to fork. If you want to fork a proof of work system, your fork had better be able to generate millions of dollars a day to pay miners or it will not be secure and be vulnerable to double spends. Distributed agreement protocols do not have this requirement. They also use orders of magnitude less energy.
Ripple recently announced that its xRapid product has moved into production. That’s Ripple’s first product that connects these two worlds, allowing financial institutions to settle RippleNet payments using XRP to buy the asset the payment needs to deliver. So, for example, a remittance company can buy XRP with dollars, sell it for Mexican pesos, and have a Mexican domestic payment en route to the recipient all in about two minutes.

77,"In simple words, blockchain is the technology the underpins digital currency like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum etc, the technology allows digital information to be distributed, but not copied. The blockchain is distributed ledger technology that was invented to support the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Blockchain monitors and verifies Bitcoin transactions by calling upon a decentralized network of volunteer-run nodes to, in effect, vote on the order in which transaction occurs. A blockchain is the structure of the data that represents a financial ledger entry, or a record of a transaction. Each transaction is digitally signed to ensure its authenticity and that no one tampers with it, so the ledger itself and the existing transaction within it are assumed to be of high integrity.
Blockchain technology has the potential to impact all recordkeeping processes, including the way the transaction is initiated, processed, authorized, recorded and reported. The bitcoin exposure and the potential Disruptive power of blockchain technology. But most miss an important point about the problems that blockchain solves. It is important to recognize that trust is a fundamental element of the business transaction when two parties engage in an agreement to exchange value. Additionally, there is a potential for greater standardization and transparency in reporting and accounting, which could enable more efficient data extraction and analysis.

78,"If you look at the last 3 bull runs in 2013, 2015 and 2017, there was always a reason that stopped the bull run and mass adoption. Complete Bitcoin Price History Chart + Related Events (2009 - 2013)
Those reasons were
1: Reason stopping mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2013
In 2013, only very, very few people actually had a Bitcoin wallet, maybe 500,000 people in total . That’s only 0.005% of the world’s population. So, in 2013, you could only pay 0.005% of the population with Bitcoin. That’s why Bitcoin was a cool gimmick back then, but not much more and that’s why the 2013 hype fell off again.
2: Reason stopping mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2015
In 2015, there were more Bitcoin wallets, maybe 5M in total . That’s already 0.1% of the world’s population. So, in 2013, you could only pay 0.05% of the population with Bitcoin. Furthermore, the first businesses started to accept bitcoin and Ethereum was also launched, which enabled the first ICOs to be launched.
That was what drove the 2015 bull run. We had Bitcoin actually being used as payment here and there and there were lots of interesting blockchain technologies popping up.
However, it was still very early days back then and the hype stopped due to lack of payment options and lack of very legitimate blockchain technologies.
3: Reason stopping mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2017
In 2017, there were more Bitcoin wallets, 50M in total already. That’s already 0.5% of the world’s population, not bad.
Furthermore, there were already 100s of businesses started that accept bitcoin. However, then Bitcoin hit its scalability bottleneck and fees went up to $50, making Bitcoin completely unusable. This is what brought people back from cloud number 9 and made them realize that crypto is still not mature enough yet.
Furthermore, there was no real world usage of the blockchain yet.
That was what drove the 2017 bull run. We had Bitcoin actually being used as payment here and there and there were lots of interesting blockchain technologies popping up.
However, it was still very early days back then and the hype and adoption stopped again due to lack of payment options and lack of very legitimate blockchain technologies.
4: Reason stopping mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2018
For 2018, there is no real reason anymore, because we have more than 50M people who own cryptocurrencies. After the upcoming bull run, we will have something around 150M to 200M owning cryptos. This means that 2% of the world population already owns crypto and can pay their friends. Among younger demographics, this number is likely to be 20%.
Furthermore, we now have a lot of real-world usages of crypto that with already several million users, e.g. Dent with 3 million, BAT with 4 million MAUs.
So, for 2018, there is nothing that can really hold the next bull run back. the only thing that could hamper growth still is bans and regulations, though major nations are very crypto-friendly or agnostic, e.g. South Korea, the U.S., China or Germany.

79,"The best source I've found to study the blockchain technology and get a nice view of the whole thing right now is using the white papers from the most important infrastructure startups in the blockchain ecosystem.
If you are starting, you must know that there is a lot of buzz about blockchain technology. There tons of alternatives conceptually different each one from another. I would say the best way to start is understanding how Bitcoin works.
Being a beginner, you could make the mistake of thinking that blockchain technology and Bitcoin can be studied by separate. The reallity is that you must understand Bitcoin, and after you will be able to understand what the Blockchain Technology is.
As the concept of the private blockchains has grown, I have added some links to the most important projects and white-papers on this field. Anyway, in order to understand this concept, first you should have understood public blockchains.
So, here is a list of the most important papers I have found:
Concepts
1: Public Blockchains:
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s inventor)
The first step to start with blockchain technology should be understand where does Blockchain Technology come from.
This paper started the whole crypto revolution. It can be complex, but will give you a good understanding what has happened since the paper was published in 2008.
Ethereum: A Next Generation Smart Contract & Decentralized Application Platform (Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s creator)
I would say this is the second most important white paper in the blockchain/bitcoin history. If you are thinking about starting with Ethereum, you truly must read this paper, as it will give you a nice comprehension of what Ethereum is, and Ethereum vision about how a decentralized application should be made.
If you want to get into more tech detail, you can also read the Yellow Paper, by the CTO Gavin Wood: http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf
Ethereum: A Secure Decentralized Generalized Transaction Ledger (Gavin Wood, Ethereum’s founder)
A technical paper that takes deeper dives at describing how Ethereum will build and deliver their technology.
Sidechains:Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains (Blockstream team)
Another key concept that’s supposed to drive innovation around the Bitcoin blockchain, this one without disturbing its core principles. Also, “Simple Explanation of Bitcoin Sidechains for a less technical interpretation to the same paper.
2: Private/Permissioned Blockchains:
Multichain:
Multichain is a Bitcoin fork that allows you to create your own private blockchains with different permissions (create, send, mine…) .
Eris
Eris started as an Ethereum fork for private solutions, changing afterwards its consensus system by using Tendermint. In the same way that in Ethereum, it allows you to create Touring complete Smart-Contracts using Solidity as the programming language.
Coding
Once you have understood the key concepts you will be ready to start coding!
You can start either programming for bitcoin or ethereum. Personally, as a developer, I prefer the Touring completeness of ethereum to development, as it allows you to write smart contracts (you can program directly the behaviour of your decentralized application!)
Ethereum
Dapps for Beginners : A really good manual step by step on how to create your first smart contract and Decentralized applications.
A noob Intro to programming Smart Contracts: Very nice summary about Smart Contract development.
Bitcoin
Here is the best step-by-step manual about blockchain/bitcoin programing I've found on the web has been this one
A developer-oriented series about Bitcoin
Happy coding!

The blockchain is a distributed database system that acts as an “open ledger” to store and manage transactions. Each record in the database is called a block and contains details such as the transaction timestamp as well as a link to the previous block. This makes it impossible for anyone to alter information about the records retrospectively. Also, due to the fact that the same transaction is recorded over multiple, distributed database systems, the technology is secure by design.

82,"If this question could be replied in one word, then the answer would have been ‘bright.’ However, it would neither be sufficient nor explain the thought process behind the answer. So to understand the future, we should step back in the past, examine the present and then see how blockchain would fare in coming years.
Blockchain – The Past & The Present
Blockchain was conceptualized to record transactions of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoins. But there’s more to this technology than just cryptocurrency. The technology, which is powered by brilliant interdependencies woven through a digital code, is revolutionizing the business world. And businesses all across the globe from finance to healthcare are trying to streamline their processes to welcome this new era of ‘trust and accountability’ called Blockchain.
Fast Forward to Future
While blockchain technology when developed was considered best, it was also flawed in some ways. For any technology to have a future, it needs to keep evolving and developing to incorporate features that would help in solving real time issues of the current/future world.
Blockchain developers have consistently been working on new sets of blockchain platforms/networks, which are based on Direct Acyclic Graph or DAG technology and would help in solving real-world problems.
Designed to overcome the major flaws in Blockchain 1.0 i.e. original blockchain and Blockchain 2.0 i.e. Ethereum, Blockchain 3.0 is based on FFM concept i.e. fast, feeless and minerless.
Blockchain 3.0 or 3rd generation blockchain are decentralized software architectures that allow high scalability. They have instant transactions, and use only 1millionth energy of Bitcoin. All of it along with enhanced features of Blockchain 1.0.
Let’s understand how 3rd generation blockchain technology has revamped the functions of the below-mentioned industries.
1. Education Sector – With Blockchain 3.0, education sector would be able to maintain records of all its students from the time they were admitted in an institute to the time of graduation. Encrypted records are tamper-proof, thus are safe and confidential.
2. Food retail chains – Blockchain 3.0 would help food retail outlets to record their food details and track contaminated food source if any, without affecting other vendors. That too while offering complete transparency to everyone.
3. Cybersecurity –Blockchain 3.0 offers complete privacy to users. It ensures that their data is encrypted, immutable and tamper proof. Thus providing maximum cybersecurity. Blockchain 3.0, unlike Blockchain 1.0, is equipped to handle huge amount of data.
4. Real Estate sector –Blockchain would ensure fewer land scams by recording all land details in a decentralized and encrypted ledger.
Blockchain is the technology of the future. There are still some loopholes, which the industry experts are working on, but there is definitely no doubt that the future of blockchain is bright.

83,"Companies like Microsoft and Oracle will collect a financial boon by offering Blockchain as a service (BaaS), a market that’s rapidly growing as companies to use the distributed ledger technology with no spending lots of money. Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) has recognized a strong market presence and is promising enterprises a way to utilize the much-hyped technology.
Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a term for a vendor offering that helps companies to make use of Blockchain technology. It is based on the emerging scheme of XaaS or “anything as a service” that is reinventing the business world and the technology industry.

A few uses of BaaS:
In the coming years, about all the MNC’s will be using the Blockchain as a service to securely maintain customer’s record, improve stocks, and helps in recording possession.
There are numerous industries that might benefit from Blockchain technology like:
Cloud
Retails
Finance
Marketing
Healthcare industry
Insurance industry
BaaS essentially involves adding some centralization to Blockchain, which is not at all ideal. By using a BaaS model, the client can now focus on their center job the functionality of their Blockchain instead of worrying about communications and performance related issues.
