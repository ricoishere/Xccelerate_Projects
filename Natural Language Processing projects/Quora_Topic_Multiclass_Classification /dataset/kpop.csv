0,"Min Yoongi (Suga) of BTS’s backstory in particular is one of hardship, depression, and pain. He was born in Daegu, South Korea, into a poor family. Growing up, he was a good student in school, but rather than paying attention in class, he spent his time writing lyrics on scraps of paper instead as a means of pursuing his passion for music. He did mention that he was inspired to make music after listening to “Epik High” which he heard in sixth grade.
However, when his parents found out about this, they were more than angry. They threw away all of his lyrics and forced him to focus more on his studies. It was around the same time that Yoongi began developing an interest in basketball; he was extremely good at it and would play with the kids afterschool and on the weekends. There are several clips of Yoongi playing point guard and making three-pointers with accuracy.
But music was always his passion, and he continued producing despite his parents’ disapproval. At the age of 13, he began composing works and learned how to use MIDI by then. Because of the poor condition of his family, he was forced to work, but he decided to go to other places to sell his music on the streets. However, it was extremely hard to sell music, and Yoongi in both interviews and his music talks a lot about being scammed (people cheated him out of his money) for his music. One of the most heartbreaking lines he’s said was that when he tried to buy a $2 bowl of noodles, he didn’t have enough money to take the bus home; often times, he had to choose between eating and taking the bus and even more often, went hungry.
Yoongi became part of the underground rapper team known as D-Town (Daegu Town) and took on the name Gloss. An iconic rap of his goes by the title 518–062, which signifies the issue that Gwangju's area code is 062 and 518 is the date of Gwangju Democratization movement.
Around this same time, Yoongi auditioned for BigHit’s “Hit It!” audition. After auditioning, he placed 2nd out of all the rappers, and landed a spot as a trainee. He was eventually approached by Bang PD-nim himself, who promised Yoongi he would be in a rapper group with little to no choreography and heavy emphasis on his producing ability. Yoongi accepted, and he was then introduced to Namjoon. From that day, he and Namjoon have lived together (they’ve lived together the longest out of everyone in Bangtan), and they began waiting for the rest of the members.
While as a trainee, however, Yoongi began working as a newspaper delivery boy. When delivering papers, however, he was struck by a car in a hit-and-run accident which completely damaged his shoulder. Rather than telling anyone, he kept the secret to himself and fought through the pain as he practiced as a trainee under BigHit, afraid that if he told them that he would lose his career with them. To this day, Yoongi does not have full motion in that shoulder and he no longer is able to b-boy (special type of freestyle dance) because of it.
As a result, Yoongi began developing mental health concerns. He developed severe depression and social anxiety which still affects him to this day. In his song “The Last” in his Agust D album, he talks about his mental disorders which were severe enough to lead him to see a psychiatrist, and implied in the same song that he has thought about suicide (the beeping noise right before it turns to him rapping about how he’s okay now). During the HYYH era, Yoongi’s social anxiety got to him, and BTS was forced to cancel a concert because Yoongi was unable to perform. Two days later, he posted a long and emotional self-reflection about himself (transcript link below):
160110 Suga’s Tweets
Today, Yoongi is a rapper, a Korean Copyright Music Association recognized producer, one of the most outspoken Korean idols about LGBT rights and mental illness, two extremely taboo topics in South Korea, and of course, one of the seven members in BTS, arguably the world’s biggest boy band at the moment. All of his lyrics are extremely reflective of himself and society, and he isn’t afraid to talk about society-consciousness issues. He has extremely thought-provoking lyrics and quotes which continue to prove the beauty Yoongi brings to the world. Furthermore, Yoongi continues to inspire people all around the world, and continues turning people’s lives around, especially those who are also fighting depression and mental illness. Some of his best works (in my opinion in terms of lyrics) include:
•The Last (Agust D)
•Tomorrow (BTS)
•So Far Away (Agust D)
•Intro: Never Mind (BTS)
•Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life (BTS)
•First Love (BTS)
•Agust D (Agust D)
Yoongi’s early life has been filled with pain and hardship, but right now, he has well-deservedly reaped the rewards for his pain. Min Yoongi continues to be one of the most respected members in this community and is one of my biggest role models. I really hope that this inspires those reading it of the man he is, and appreciate and respect him as much as I do.
Thank you for everything, Min Yoongi.

1,"Ok so, as a Korean myself, I’ve tried to analyze what made BTS so popular worldwide unlike so many other K-Pop groups. At a glance, some might be confused as to what the difference is. Yet from my analysis (and this is something subjective, I’m not saying I’m 100% right), BTS is a lot more dynamic than most groups. After watching a BTS music video, I watched a Wanna One (heard of it?) music video and realized that compared to BTS, Wanna One was way too bland. It was cliche, there was nothing new about it at all. I don’t know if it’s because of BTS’s name (translated: Bulletproof Boys), but they have a certain explosive or even aggressive vibe that’s only been seen so far in Big Bang or maybe EXO. Also, while other groups might be too “Korean” per se, BTS seems to be “Asian”. Only one or two of the members give off a Korean vibe. (And yes, a Korean can tell apart a Korean vibe from a Chinese,Japanese,etc. vibe. Same applies for all Asians. To the Europeans out there, it’s like how you can tell apart Dutch from German from French) Some members give off a Chinese vibe, others Japanese, and you’ll notice that BTS’s popularity in Asia as well is unprecedented. Finally, I think BTS actually has a “manly” feel to it. While a lot of other groups come off as slightly effeminate, BTS has a testosterone, powerful image to it that really sets it off with a bang.
P.S. A lot of boy bands in K-Pop thrive on their gorgeous looks, but not really talent in dance or music. Some only live on their looks and their dance talent, and especially lack really good rappers. BTS’s rapper has a really great growl and delivery that other K-Pop groups don’t have, they’re good looking, good at dancing, and singing. Some might say they’re the best K-pop group by far

2,"First of all, it’s “naega (내가)”, which means ‘I’. For ‘you’ it’s “nega (네가)”. So no, it’s not a slur, even by ear unless heard by a non-native speaker.
It’s a part of their native language. What do you want them to do? Suddenly stop using “I” and “You” all of a sudden just to satisfy the English language? Don’t be ignorant. It shouldn’t even be anyone’s opinion whether they should or should not keep the words. It’s another language. Either you suck it up and accept language barriers or continue to be one of those ignorant people that think the world revolves around English. Yes, it’s one of the most popular languages in the world, but it isn’t the only language in the world. So no, as a matter of fact, Koreans should not change their language around just to satisfy English speakers.

3,"This is my opinion, so don’t get upset over what I write.
Anyway, let’s see what overrated means. It means to have a higher opinion of someone or something than is deserved. Ok, now we’ll get on to the actual question knowing what overrated means and not assuming that it means anything worse or better.
#1: Definitely BLACKPINK.
Don’t get me wrong, I am a BLINK. I have been since their debut. I bought their lightstick and album and support them. The reason I am a BLINK is because I love the members. They are super funny and kind, and they have a great bond. I mean, they’ve been training together for 4+ years. Here’s the problem. They are not the only OR first to do a girl crush concept. A whole lot of BLINKs (of course not me) say, “blackpink is the best, blackpink is revolutionary- “ NO. Just stop. They are neither the best or revolutionary. And what is with their company? Of course I know this isn’t blackpink’s fault, but blackpink is super underworked. While TWICE was on music shows promoting their songs every three months, BLACKPINK was living in a pretty pink house watching TV or doing that kind of stuff. That’s not the girls’ fault but honestly there needs to be some kind of work going on that’s not staying in a house for a show. My next point. BLACKPINK is definitely mainstream. They release dance songs and tbh they sound pretty similar by now! Groups like BTS, Seventeen, who produce their own songs or at least contribute don’t have songs that sound similar. I understand that YG is a much bigger company than Big Hit or Pledis, but there is really no correlation between that because YG artists such as GD produce their own music. Anyway, this is MY opinion, so don’t hate me for it.
#2: EXO.
Ok. I will admit that I don’t really like EXO that much. I will do everything in my power to make this as unbiased as possible ;) The first reason I think EXO is overrated is because their songs are really mainstream and meaningless. The lyrics are about love, breakups, etc. Most of their songs are a skip for me just cause they sound similar. I understand that they don’t produce their own songs but again, as I said earlier, it makes the songs sound similar and repetitive. I don’t have much more to go on about them because I don’t really know EXO that well~I hope EXO-Ls don’t get too offended and same for BLINKs. And I know how hard they have worked until now, especially because a few members left, but yeah these are my reasons.
#3: Wanna One.
I put them in with a lot of hesitation. Yes, I know they worked EXTREMELY hard to get to where they are right now, but Wanna One is just a no for me. I watched all of Produce 101 season 2 and even voted as I am a Korean and live in Korea. It is hard for me to say this because I witnessed them struggling and training to debut. Honestly, I had high hopes for them because they have potential and are talented, but I was really disappointed with Energetic, Beautiful, Boomerang, Light, etc. It just got worse and worse and eventually I stopped listening to their song. Second, after their controversy, I was surprised. I thought they wouldn’t be much different from their on-camera personas, but wow was I surprised when they showed this immature, rude side to them. It certainly gave me a bad image of them.
-end of answering the question but there’s more-
You might be wondering, where’s BTS and TWICE? First BTS. They give good QUALITY music and it doesn’t sound cringy or whatever. They deserve the fame they are getting right now because honestly i know everyone says this but they worked especially hard. Imagine living with 6 other friends in a tiny apartment. Imagine choosing between dinner and coming home. At least YG and SM provided these. And from what I’ve heard, most if not all of Wanna One had at least the money for basic necessities. BTS has lyrics that you can relate with that talk about their experiences, like insecurity and depression and topics that are considered taboo here. TWICE. Um, given the hate they’re getting they definitely do deserve to be more famous. Everyone says they’re overrated but they really aren’t. They are really hardworking and deserve more love based on the hate they’re getting. Thanks for reading.

6,"Yeah, I think BTS's popularity will die down. It won't be because of a lack of talent or quality music. There are some basic factors at play, though. Here are a few:
-The Korean pop music industry doesn't seem to build enduring careers. A lot of stress and restrictions are placed on the artists, which can be stifling to creativity. With male artists and groups, companies seem to be working to beat the military service clock - get them as much fame and exposure as possible before they have to go serve in the military. By the time they are done, things have changed. Their fanbases got older, so did they, maybe they want families or to pursue other things, or they're just tired. The KPop machine seems to overwork artists, and BigHit is definitely doing that with Bangtan. These men are gonna get tired eventually. They're gonna want lives. Families. Some freedom.
-BTS is getting worldwide recognition and really breaking into the US pop market, which is great, but the American pop industry doesn't build enduring careers either. BTS is being pushed extra hard because they are breaking new ground. They are legitimately paving the way for more K-artists to achieve broader success. That's amazing. Meanwhile, the American sensationalism culture around celebrities is hideous, and our most famous pop artists crash and burn all the time. Korean pop culture ain't much better - they just try to prevent the self-destruction of artists through higher levels of restriction and control. BTS is now susceptible to the nastiness of their own country AND the US. They're gaining more haters as they gain more fans, and they're under even more scrutiny. Spoiler alert: this is counter-intuitive to healthy life, period. Nobody is supposed to live like this. Suicide rates among celebs in both SK and US are pretty high because of it. My guess is that at some point they're gonna NEED to pull back from the public eye for their own sanity, and when that time comes, I sincerely hope they choose to take care of themselves first.
-Their fanbase is young. Young people grow up and their tastes change. As a high school teacher, I am anticipating a wave of kids a few years from now reminiscing about their “BTS phase.” My 11-year-old daughter, who introduced me to BTS and loves them dearly, is more into Panic at the Disco these days. It is what it is.
-The members are young. Young people grow up and their tastes change. This pop thing isn't really designed to be done forever. These boys have other talents and interests, and may wanna pursue other stuff. Taehyung loves acting and visual art, and his true musical passion is jazz. Yoongi almost left BTS early on because he has desired a serious hip-hop career from the jump, and while Bangtan is awesome they are NOT a hip-hop group. Both Yoongi and Namjoon found a passion for producing, and I could see Namjoon doing activism work in the future. Jin is a business owner with a passion for food. Jungkook is a budding filmmaker. Hoseok and Jimin are both amazing dancers who could easily take it to the professional level, open their own studios, train idol trainees, choreograph. BTS is not the sum of these guys' life's work. They've got much more inside them that I hope the world gets to see.
So yeah, the popularity of BTS will not last forever. But I think their message, impact, and legacy will last a long time. They've touched a lot of lives, saved a lot of lives, and that matters more than hit songs and record sales. I hope they get a chance to follow their other dreams and live full, happy lives.

7,"Oh my goodness, it must be because they had a lovers' quarrel or they're fed up with fan fiction and shipping, yes?
NO! Let me say that again, NO! NO! NO! Big Hit has not ordered them to stay away from each other, managers are not keeping them apart.
Taehyung just lost his grandfather. This was the man who gave him his name and raised him. This was the man who fed him and loved him. This was the man he loved. His grandfather died in the middle of a tour, a tour that he had worked towards for years. He went home, said goodbye to one of the father figures in his life and then had to immediately join the tour again and pretend everything was just peachy. I mean he didn't have any choice, yes? How dare he put his feelings above everyone who purchased tickets to see him? How could he let down his members and grieve for the man who raised him so soon after losing the grandmother who raised him?
Jungkook has had accidents on this tour. It's taken a toll on his body. Also, and I am relaying information given by my colleagues, the MGA performance with Charlie Puth was a disaster. There were issues backstage, there were issues with sound and music, there were issues with the stage. Jungkook felt he did not do his best and disappointed fans. It was made worse watching his members struggle on a song they've sung dozens of times. There may have even been disappointment with Charlie himself. He's also not obligated to act like a giddy school boy when girl groups are performing. More than likely he was sitting there agonising over what a mess the night had been.
Lastly they've been touring for months. Sleeping in vans, planes, hotels. Eating hotel food. Not being close to their loved ones and friends. They're TIRED. They're tired and they start the tour up again in 3 days. They don't like to disappoint their fans.

Jimin is considered the most perverted member
Jungkook is apparently afraid of microwaves
Namjoon has a funny way of pronouncing “vacuum”
Whenever Jimin is drunk, he acts all cute and fluffy uwu
bonus: He also sometimes speaks in third person and calls himself Diminie
Hoseok has low tolerance. Basically whenever he gets drunk his face gets all red and he kinda just sits there, zoning out a lot.
Yoongi seems to understand English in American interviews, but either has trouble speaking it or is embarrassed about the way he speaks (either because of his accent or his pronunciation I’m not sure), because he doesn’t speak English in American interviews
Seokjin cooks most of the time for members, but Yoongi can cook too
Hoseok and Jungkook love churros
Jimin is the only member who can do a full split (right, left, and middle split)
Namjoon said if he didn’t live in Korea he would want to live in Australia
Taehyung once made up a day on their tour and called it International Hug Day, and gave a hug to all the members
Jungkook once said that Taehyung put kiwis on the egg shelf and Seokjin screamed because he thought the eggs have grown fur
Hoseok and Seokjin are the two members that get scared the easiest
Seokjin’s favorite hair color on himself is pink
Jungkook looooves dogs
Taehyung has very nice, delicate hands
FAKE LOVE was originally going to be more depressing and have more of a negative tone to it, and Namjoon said that they moved up 6 1/2 pitches (which is the FAKE LOVE you hear now), and the rap line had a difficult time adjusting to that pitch.
Spring Day, Magic Shop, 134340, and FAKE LOVE are a few songs that seem to have the most even amount of lines distributed (not counting live performances).

10,"Okay so, I’m both a Blink and a ReVeluv, but I have to say I prefer Red Velvet.
But let’s break it down into categories…
First of all: music
I like BlackPink songs but up to certain extent (with the exception of Stay) their songs are very similar, with a similar beat, structures, division, etc. And I know they were all produced by Teddy, but I would like to see more of what they can do in different styles, the lack of songs is also something that limit they’re ability to try different concepts.
On the other hand, Red Velvet songs each one sounds very different from each other, and are very innovative on the song structures. Even though they are different I end up liking their songs.
So for me, this point goes to Red Velvet
Second: Dancing
So for me, here is a tie.
(I have to first mention that the hability to freestyle is not what defines a good dancer)
BlackPink dances are very strong which gives them a powerful vibe on the scene.
Red Velvet has tried different styles of dancing which include strong, mix of contemporary, etc.
BUT, the style of dancing doesn’t define how difficult a dance is. For example, In BlackPink, there’s Bommbayah, which is difficult to perform, but there’s also Forever Young, which is pretty easy to perform. And in Red Velvet, there’s Dumb Dumb, which believe it or not, is difficult to pull of, but there’s also Bad Boy, which is not that difficult to dance to.
Taking into considerations other stages (such as dance performances) they all have been part of, I can say that there’s actually not a better group in dancing, and their skills in dancing are similar. Once again…the style of dancing does not define how difficult a dance is.
Vocal
So, in this case I have to go for Red Velvet. Even though, Blackpink have nice voices, they have a not that good technique, constantly straining their voices. On the other hand, Red Velvet have a great vocal technique.
Rap
I have to go with BlackPink here, even though I like Irene and Yeri, they are not the best rapers. BlackPink’s Lisa and Jennie slay in rap.
And Finally: Concept
Red Velvet change their concept every comeback and they are extremely fit on each one. They can be cute, fierce, playful and killer witches all in once. I like the girl crush concept but, BlackPink usually repeats it, after two years I still like it, but I do prefer Red Velvet concepts way better.
So, in my perspective, I prefer Red Velvet. But I consider they are all talented and great in what they do :)

Most people (non-ARMYs/ non-kpop fans) thought that their fame was sudden, that they suddenly, out of nowhere, hit #1 on BB200.

(source: http://www.gaonchart.co.kr/main/... )
*UPDATE* :
@shadow_twts posted this as proof that BTS' success in the US wasn't sudden: BTS Never Had an Overnight Success in US: The Era Before “Her”
TLDR: Even their 2013's debut song already entered Billboard World Digital Song and stayed for 3 weeks. Since then, they consistently charted and entered more Billboard chart categories with subsequent albums and stayed for at least a few weeks (a rare feat especially for a rookie group that's NOT from big companies) until they're able to chart in one of the main categories, Billboard 200 with HYYH Pt 2 at #171. Since then, they gradually move up the chart with newer albums.
So what could this progress be attributed to? In other words, what made people so invested in them?
A bit about my story on how I got into them…
I was into kpop since ~2008. In short, at first I enjoyed it because of the catchy songs and dance but as the industry became more saturated with many, many new groups debuting with identical sounds , style and vibe, I lost interest in it - with some exceptions eg Bigbang, 2ne1 which I sometimes checked for release of new songs.
Then one day, I clicked on Save Me MV which were in my recommendations. I thought it was a good song. I searched for more of their songs just to find if there were similar ones that I would probably like. And to my surprise, I liked most of their songs, and the main reason was the LYRICS. I was impressed with Spine Breaker and Paldogangsan (Satoori Rap) at the time because they talked about a social issue among students in Korea at that time and the latter one about the division that exists based on provinces in South Korea, something very rarely found in an industry that is usually superficial.
*Spine Breaker lyrics & explanation:
BTS – Spine Breaker (English Translation + Ramblings)
*Paldogangsan lyrics & explanation:
BTS – Satoori Rap (English Translation and Ramblings)
The more I dive into their discography, the more I appreciate them because they feel genuine, honest and relatable. And personally, because they also talked about loneliness and anxiety, which were from their own personal experiences.
Of course, as I learn more and more about them, I realized that they are distinctive from other groups by their vocal colours, exceptional rap skills, involvement in music production & idea and the list goes on. But on a personal level, the CORE of it would be that I can simply relate to them.
I don't speak for the fandom or the gp as I am only 1 person, but I've encountered many interviews, tweets and articles from MANY ARMYs that tell similar stories, that is, they can relate or bts' music gives them some kind of comfort/strength.
So to answer the question, I honestly have not seen a group as close to BTS' success right now. Of course, most idols work hard & have talent but to get even as close as BTS, they must be distinctive, show individuality and have that X factor. Sure, if you have the 'it' song, you may get that fame for a while, but will it last in the long run?
**These are based on MY opinions and personal experience. You may agree or disagree.

12,"I assisted to their two concerts in my country last year, and the second day I brought a small but visible banner with “SOPE♡” on it (I was in the vip section, so I was very close to them) we didn’t want to write YOONSEOK cause it was too large and also because it is the ‘ship name’ WE (armys) gave to them and we didn’t want them too feel uncomfortable or something, so we thought ‘sope’ was more appropiate since they themselves call their friendship like that.
The thing is when the concert started they first performed a song or two (don’t remember too well) and then introduced themselves, in that short time, they actually looked a lot too the public while the others were talking, Hoseok saw my banner since he was closer to the place we were (Yoongi was at the other side of the stage) and I’m saying this really confident even though I don’t have material proof, because he pointed at me and smiled (very fondly, almost giggled but not in a mean kinda way, more like in a cute one) and there wasn’t any other banners lifted in my section cause I looked everywhere to see if it was really me the one who was being pointed at….(shookt, it really was me) he didn’t seem to be annoyed at all, actually he seemed moved by the fact that people from all around the world knew he and Yoongi are very close friends. After that, they went back to their choreography positions and he told something to Yoongi, now that could’ve been anything, but since it happened so shortly after he saw my banner, Id like to assume he told him about it, also, after that, they were really close throughout the whole thing (that iconic sope moment playing with the giant army bomb, that happened here!!)
Personally, i think they like us to acknowledge their friendship, they don’t really care if it is in a romantic way as long as it is not represented in a sexual manner, because that’s part of their personal life and they can perceive it as rude, weird or.... even funny (who knows?????) either reaction would cause half of the fandom (if not the whole) to heartbreak and they probably don’t want that.

15,"Ok guys, PREPARE FOR THE TEA ☕️
Bts
They are not overrated, you think they are because you are jealous/an anti
Yea I like bts and I know about how they struggled just for their dreams. And still, a LARGE number of people saying THEY.ARE.FREAKING.OVERRATED. Plz just SHUT UP , for heaven’s sake
2. ARMYS are infamous
Oh please , I see those annoying yt comments like ,’any ARMYS here?!?!?!’here and there and it’s getting old.
3. Stop complaining BTS vocal line is weak.
BTS is originally a Hip-Hop group, and their raps are supposed to be better than vocals. Ppl need to know that every group on the world has their unique strengths and weaknesses.
Got7
is underrated.
They are popular internationally, but they are still gaining attention in Korea. They can produce a wide variety of genres of music, not only dark, mature and cute—because they can be ALL THREE!! So please, stan talent, stan them.
IKON
Goodbye Road is the best among Love Scenario, Killing Me and Goodbye Road.
Goodbye Road has BIGBANG vibes, because IKON is destined to be the next BIGBANG, so there’s no point COMPLAINING.
Goodbye Road is great, but it somehow shows how YG ruins their good vocals.
Goodbye Road isn’t a song that requires hard-hitting vocals like LOONA songs, but sad/ballad songs need soothing/sweet vocals, and I sometimes think some of the IKON members don’t fit Goodbye Road.
Wanna One
Is extremely overrated.
I know that they struggled to debut in PD101 Season 2, but their music after PD101S2 doesn’t rlly have uniqueness and their own style. Wanna One doesn’t really stand out to me and I don’t get the hype around them.
I support their disbandment.
DONT KILL ME BECAUSE OF THESE OPINIONS. After IOI disbanded, the girls separated and most of them had success.
Disbandment only means you won’t see your fav guys/girls together in a group but they aren’t dead or something. You can still meet them as actors/actresses , soloists or in other groups and that brings success.
TWICE
They still need improvement in singing rapping and dancing, but THEY.ARENT.TALENTLESS.
If they are totally talentless, they won’t be picked by JYP to debut in Twice
SO.
SHUT.
THE.
FUCK.
UP.
ANTIS.
Their cute concept is getting boring.
I know that Koreans love the cuuuuuuuuuute concept, but I am one of the fans waiting for the girl crush concept. I know they match the girl crush concept much more.
Gfriend
They are the best girl group in 4th gen K-Pop.
GFRIEND has enchanted vocals and can sing a lot of songs in those sweet voices and all six of them have a different style of singing (eg. Umji’s vocals suit ballad songs) and they are ACES in dancing (watch their vids about them dancing in Weekly Idol)
Red Velvet
They have no stage presence.
I’m a normal person, but I find the RV lives boring, and that means they hv no stage presence. But their songs are freaking bops for sure. (Power Up isn’t that great tho)
BLACKPINK
These girls are talented, but YG does a GREAT JOB managing them.
Notice me being sarcastic. They have yearly comebacks, thanks to the bad management by YG. Besides they won’t be popular if the international fans don’t support them.
LOONA
Hi High is not a disappointing song and it IS.NOT.A.FUCKING.CUTE.CONCEPT.
Their predebut is great, but Hi High is an UNDERRATED ENERGETIC MASTERPIECE and not that typical and common ‘cute’ concept.
These girls are talented.
I listened to their predebut songs and BlockBerry Creative does a good job showing their talents in singing, rapping and dancing.
They deserve to be the best girl group in 5th gen KPOP.
They beat a lot of idols in talents and visuals, now we Orbits are only waiting for masterpieces and prizes for them.
IZ*ONE
La Vie en Rose, their debut track, is a MASTERPIECE.
I’m not really hyped of their debut, and I’m supposed that they’re the next Wanna One in me. But La Vie en Rose just surprised me, and IM IN LOVE WITH JO YURI’S VOICE.
I feel that Produce 48 is not a FAIR TEST.
In IZ*ONE, there are nine Koreans and three Japanese. It should be 50:50 Korean and Japanese ppl to be fair and they should include Lee Kaeun in the Korean lineup and Koto Moe and Matsui Jurina in the Japanese lineup.
NCT
The NCT concept isn’t that hard to understand.
It isn’t hard for real, but the former MCs in Weekly Idol made it look like it’s hard. Great job dissing idols.
Other underrated rookie groups
People nowadays aren’t giving rookie groups a chance.
Like fromis_9, Victon and JBJ (disbanded) , their songs are SUPERB, Love Bomb (fromis_9) is a REALLY CATCHY song and I recommend it.
Don’t kill me because of my trashy opinions and thank you guysss!! :3

16,"Why yes, in all aspects hahahaha, before the whole gift banning BigHit and BTS decided this year, most of their clothes, and collections at their dorm are gifts from fans. BTS treasures everything Armys give them, in fact, during their debut and early years, other groups fandoms mocked BTS because their clothes aren’t stylish or branded, so many Armys that time gave them high end clothes during fansigns or as birthday gifts. Until now, the members wear accessories or clothes that fans gave them.
As for things they kept in their rooms. RM’s old bedroom was full of the Ryan plushies he received from fans.
But if you want a very sentimental side from them, let’s go back during their debut days. So back then, Army was just a really small fandom :( and that time, they wanted to give something BTS to celebrate their 1000th day a group I think, so these k-armys chipped in on buying a set of bowls for the members to use at home haha (really cute.) And I promise, whenever the members move to a better or large dorm, they bring those bowls around too.
^See those bowls on the shelf near Jin’s head? Well, they are the same bowls he used in Run BTS Ep 44 when he made RM and Tae’s food for their hike.
There are plenty of other examples of them with the gifts they got from fans. Though these are the top examples that I can think about right now.

17,"I have tried to listen to other K-Pop groups like Exo, Red Velvet, Blackpink, and Got 7. They are just okay, that's it. BTS is unique, they are very individualistic. They barely fit the K-Pop sound, which to me is very cheesy and boring.
I heard BTS first before I attempted other groups, and I had to turn it off halfway through a song. BTS is intelligent, they care about the lyrics, and the sound. They don't just put a song out just for the heck of it. More quality, than quantity, that peaks American interest because we are begging for a new sound. Some of us are sick of the American Idol crap that won't go away for years. Prior to finding BTS, I never heard the radio. I thought everything sucked. Only foreigners seem to make better music like Adele, Birdy. I don't know why but it's true.
BTS are in a class of their own.

18,"1.) Soyeon from (G)I-dle, Jessie and Yeeun from CLC are the best female rappers of this generation.
2.) I don’t know why Blackpink is so hyped up. In my opinion the 3 best GG should be TWICE, Red velvet and CLC. BP’s talen is mediocre and their dancing is dull.
3.) Lisa is not the best dancer of this generation.
4.) I’m sick and tired of most idols doing lip sync in their performances and fans defending them. If they really had talent then they wouldn’t have to lip sync. If it’s because of the dancing, some dances aren’t even that hard to do.
4.) Gfriend and TWICE are so far the best dancers and with the best choreos.
5.) kpop fans are too hypocritical. They praise 2nd generation groups calling them kings and queens but barely knowledge that it all started with the 1st generation of kpop.
6.) I cringe sometimes when I heard a bit of auto tune in kpop songs.
7.) kpop performances aren’t as glamorous as fans make them out to be unless you really go out which I rarely see.
8.) YG entertainment is trash. I respect the CEO for being a pioneer in kpop but as a CEO, he should look for a different job.
9.) boy group and girl group stans fight against each other to prove which gender is better but don’t even aknowledge groups that have both genders as members. (EX: Kard).
10.) groups from small companies have better music than groups from the big3 because they tend to have more variety and different styles.
11.) BTS are my favorite group and the only group I stan besides another group, they are my everything but they still need to improve their vocals a bit more.
12.) kpop is nothing special. Is just music in a different language and more fun and colorful but it’s not something that’s too superior for it to not enter the American market. If anything, it can help decrease the racism and stereotypes that Americans have towards Asians.
13.) not writing/composing/producing your own music is not bad but if you do, people will respect you more because the audience will see that you’re speaking from the heart and can relate even more. That’s better than handing it over to an idol to have all these fans calling them the best. That’s like me giving a speech that it’s not mine but people still love me and praise me because I’m a good speaker yet there’s no credit going to the person who came up with the speech.
And thats all all I have as of now.

19,"There is one thing that, as an ARMY, I am still really sad about. When BTS went through LA airport earlier this year (March 2018) there was a fan-project called the “Purple Ribbon Project”. ARMYs there to meet them held the ribbon like a fence to try and stop people from mobbing them. It was for the most part a huge success. BTS had noticed it, the media had noticed it, and it was very special to the fandom.
Not long after GOT7 fans staged a project where they used green ribbons as a shield at the airport.
It turned out that the team behind the purple ribbon project had been contacted by iGOT7s who asked for advice on how to hold a similar event, and the team gave them tips. The team wasn’t asked for permission to replicate the project, and they didn’t give explicit permission to replicate the project; they didn’t even know if the iGOT7s were serious, but their view was that these projects could change kpop culture, and lead to all fans being more respectful at the airports.
ARMY didn’t react well. I saw words like “traitor” and “inconsiderate” being thrown around online. They said that the team were bad because they didn’t consult the community before responding to the iGOT7s. ARMYs were upset that their special project was being used by someone else.
And honestly, this really disappoints me. ARMYs slandered and abused a team that worked extremely hard to pull off a truly amazing project, simply because they did something that was aimed at helping other idols get the space and respect they deserved. If this incident hadn’t happened, who knows how many more projects could’ve happened between then and now? But the teams lost the support of a huge fraction of the community over such a childish and petty reaction.
There’s attacking other fandoms, there’s attacking the media, and then there’s attacking our own, who have contributed immensely and who had the absolute best intentions. I’m just incredibly disappointed.
The project’s twitter was @PurpleRibbnARMY and the organising team is @ProtectionARMY. BTS have started using private airport exits.

20,"Rather than different, I think maybe a bit less exaggerated is Suga and Jhope. Suga tries to be loud on-camera for the sake of the fans and to appear on camera at least, but I think he probably spends days without talking to anyone or having any human contact. He’s said himself that he isn’t someone who likes humans nor does he like living with other people - he’s pretty much a loner and would probably much rather be getting on with producing music in his studio than interacting with other people.
Jhope is a sweet guy and very kind-hearted - I think his sound effects and to some extent his cuteness is exaggerated. The way he behaves sometimes, he just seems to forget to do it, so I think to some extent he doesn’t do it enough for it to be embedded in him. But all of them probably have exaggerated characters on-screen while at home they may just be lazing about, trying to get some rest. They all seem pretty loud and talkative though, so I think rather than thinking they’re fake, we should just understand that anything boring on-camera will be cut out by the producers and editors, so naturally they try to be funnier and louder, not necessarily because they are.

22,"Originally Answered: How can people not like BTS?
Honestly, a lot of the time it comes down to prejudice.
A lot of the people that hate/dislike BTS claim a lot of things that - if time was taken to do some actual research - they would know isn’t true at all. Examples being: BTS is homophobic, racist, sexist, brain-washing people, puppets etc… And of course then there’s the stuff that is purely based on definition and opinion: BTS is trash, ugly, their music sucks, untalented, annoying etc…
Now people who know BTS, even a little bit, know for a fact that BTS are not racist, homophobic, sexist, evil or fake puppets. It only takes a little research to clear those accusations which sadly, people nowadays don’t do. It’s fun to hate on the world’s biggest boy band after all. It’s funny though, some people try label them as ‘racist’ and then slang off at their Asian ethnicity, calling them “chinese” and that they can’t understand their language, and that they look like “girls” (These haters tend to forget that racism comes in all shapes and forms and doesn’t just limit to skin colour but ALL races and ethnicities. Asians are faced with racism a lot, and BTS entering the Western music market has sparked the disapproval of a lot of racist people.)
“Celebrities are fake, they’re puppets.” This is a notion that celebrities will never truly be able to dispel, people are entitled to their opinions and controversies and at the end of the day, a bit of controversy and mystery is beneficial in their line of work. But people who say this about BTS, again, have not done research. They simply see the overly-energetic boys being loud and silly in interviews and judge them based on their camera personas. I bet they haven’t seen a single episode of AHL, their dance practices, their Youtube red series or bothered reading the lyrics of their songs outlining hard work, injuries, sweat, exhaustion and the price they had to pay for a chance of success. No. They see the superficial 3 minutes interviews and make a premature opinion on the band. Prejudice.
The whole “ BTS is trash, their music sucks, untalented, annoying etc…” is completely unarguable. Why? because opinions will be opinions. We all have an artist/song/genre we don’t enjoy to listen to, right? But even so, whether you dislike Justin Bieber (for example) as a person or simply don’t enjoy his music. JB is a popstar and an artist who has changed someone’s life for the better through his work, you can’t deny that. There is an audience out there that love him and have been inspired by him, and that should be respected. Music is universal and there’s something for everyone - that’s the beauty of it. JB is not my cup of tea, but I don’t hate him (or any artist for that matter) because they are someone’s source of motivation and inspiration in life. I respect that.
Sadly, not everyone thinks like this though and will gladly bash and ‘trash-talk’ BTS simply because they are upset over their popularity. Maybe jealous that their favourite artist isn’t gaining as much recognition. BTS came from dirt though, and people who have researched and gained insight into their story would respect how far they have come.
Untalented? I suppose people have different definitions. But maybe being a singer, composer, dancer, public figure, ambassador, lyricist, producer, entertainer, performer, MC, actor, and all that doesn’t impress some people? maybe none of those things is considered to be a talent? Or maybe they’re not educated on just how much BTS does.
How can people not like BTS? I’m not sure. How can people not like a band that stands for human rights and self love? that stands against violence and supports a generation of youth that is in dire need? that - through music - comfort those with anxiety, depression, and mental health problems that desperately need a voice? “BTS is overrated” No. Saving lives and promoting love is not overrated, nor should it ever be. I wish people who hated BTS would look past their prejudices and bias opinions and realise that, whether or not they like their songs, their message is to be acknowledged and commended.

23,"I answers this question on another post so imma put my answer here too.
This is actually a very interesting question. I’m a fan of BTS (so big in fact I’m going to their first stadium concert in NY), but I will answer this question as honestly as I can.
I think BTS’s fame will die out soon and here’s why. Hear me out( and stay with me I hope this doesn't get too confusing).
Recently, their last title tracks have not been getting as much love. Fake Love was ok, but kind of messy and seemed rushed. Idol came off the same, and I don’t know if it was a result of coming out with two albums in one year or what. Even their title track before that, DNA, was unliked by MANY BTS fans. Don’t get me wrong, I love those songs but I could see where people were coming from.
Title tracks are important because they set the tone for the whole album, and what to expect. My timelines on instagram and twitter were dedicated fans, who have stanned BTS for years, saying that the album wasn't what they expected (and not in a good way). I agreed with a lot of the stuff and I thought they would go with more traditional sounds (like DDAENG for example), but went with a more EDM roots, which disappointed me.
When idols create music that their fanbase doesn't like, their popularity will drop and that’s it. So if the next album is similar to this one, I have a feeling people will start to lose interest.
BTS are popular worldwide right now, especially in Western Media. In the next 2 years if they haven't established themselves officially in the Western Market they will not be as focused on as they are right now (by that I mean award shows and nominations, Grammy Interviews or awards in general, etc).
I don’t think their fanbase will die out, that’s for sure. I do think army’s will age though and it’s hard for people to keep themselves so dedicated to voting 50 times or running a fan page when you get to college or start getting busy with life.
BTS won’t die out or shrivel up. They’ve already broken records and proved themselves as an international success . I think they kind of remind me of One Direction, like how they will achieve great success and all pursue great solo careers as well. When they do disband, I couldn't see any of them running away from the public eye and I believe they will continue with acting, dancing, singing, and producing as it seems like that is what they are born to do.
If I were to put a time cap on it, I would bet they would disband in the next five years then continue with solo careers. They are all hardworking and deserve all their success. They have been together working day and night for 7 straight years and have given their youth to this career, and solo careers would certainly let them relax more. Also, another factor is that they really are being overworked. So many people say this about their idols but in BTS’s case it’s pretty extreme. I’m especially worried about Jimins health, he gets skinnier every comeback and I don’t think they are losing healthy weight. I’m sure even after they disband they will be able to tell us more about their personal lives, like what it was really like to work so much and more of their hardships. I love these boys <3.

25,"Red Velvet. I’ll try to give a simple answer:
Although I enjoy YG’s artists’ styles and their aesthetic, I do not enjoy the abnormally large time gaps between comebacks.
SM, who are known infamously for scouting for looks, has a good vocal training system. Red Velvet’s vocals are stable and beautiful. Rose’s voice is nasal. Many have said this, but this will end up straining her vocal chords. It is highly detrimental to continue with that nasally voice.
Also, Blackpink is…generic. They’re not the first group to go with the ‘badass but pretty’ style, and they won’t be the last. If you check out their songs, you’ll see. To me, their songs all sound the same. My personal favourite is ‘Stay’. It’s not very popular, but I enjoy the nostalgia that is in that song.
Honestly, I love Blackpink’s aesthetic. Did you see the balloons in Stay? How Rose swung on that chandelier in Ddu du Ddu du (Is that how you spell it?)? Jennie’s laundry aesthetic in Solo? I literally tripped over nothing for Blackpink’s aesthetics. Their visuals are not to be underestimated either.
But generic is generic. Red Velvet’s ‘Peekaboo’ really gave me a thrill and I loved it. ‘Dumb dumb’, ‘Ice-cream cake’, ‘Russian Roulette’… They appealed to me a lot. I loved them. I thought it was a very creative, artistic way to twist music… I liked how SM gave them a (sort of) freedom to allow them to have genres and make their songs dark while sounding nice and musical.
But maybe that’s just my opinion, haha.

Obviously he's Nation's Baby Boy and BTS love him crazily. All the BTS members have love for each other but when it comes to Jungkook, they say he's their son. He came at the age of 15 and they literally raised him. They took care of him as fathers and love the guy to the death.
I would have been blessed if I had 6 such loving hyungs. He's blessed with 6 fathers who love him more than anything in the world.
Even after growing up and being 21 years old, he is still BTS and ARMY's baby boy. In his each birthday, ARMY cries saying he has grown another year. But truly he's the most beloved maknae
………....…...
………..
……
SEHUN
Sehun looks like hyung rather than the dongsaeng. After all this, he is still loved as a cute baby in the group. They seem to love him a lot.
During concerts they tease him, play with him and hit him but still they love him. He sometimes brag about being a maknae in a cute way. He was sad that the members wished him 11 minutes late in his birthday. Actually the baby of EXO.
Suho shares his room with Sehun and if Sehun is late to come home, he scolds him like a mother and tells him to come home faster. He nags like a mother
………....…...
………..
……
TAEMIN
Taemin also debuted when he was a teen. So he was completely a baby to the group. He was bullied in school so the members used to walk him school to prevent him from getting bullied. That maybe was the cutest thing I've ever seen.
RIP Jonghyun even referred Taemin as his son. In an interview, the members said they had seen Taemin growing up as an adult. So he jokingly said he has seen the members getting old.
They are always seem to hold his hand, giving him hugs and loving him unconditionally

Tae and Jimin once went out from their dorm late at night unsupervised and were caught by their manager at a PC Café Shop. All the members were later scolded because they didn’t notice the two were missing.
Jimin is not fond of spicy food.
Jimin is really smart (gets a lot of high marks), even made opening speech to his school.
Namjoon’s father calls him Jooni Mini.
Tae’s father calls him baby bear and his mother calls him honey bear (childhood nicknames).
Hoseok used to wear braces (if you ever wondered why he has such perfect nice teeth)
Hoseok and Namjoon once joked about BTS being global stars back in 2013 (they really are now, they did it I’m so proud)
Back when Tae wasn’t revealed as a member yet, Jimin posted a selca with Tae’s back and the fans who were unaware that time thought it was Jk’s back in the picture.
Yoongi gave fans gifts during his birthday. Gifts he wrapped himself (together with other members), handwritten notes he made himself too.
BTS watched Fantastic Four with ARMYs as a thank you gift for their first music show win. (Yes they sat at the same cinema *cries in international*)
When Jin was still a trainee, a group of girls who were visiting Korea back then asked to take a picture with him after seeing him in the street. Little did they know that he was worldwide handsome in the future.
Jin’s father is a CEO of one of Samsung’s suppliers or distributor or something.
Yoongi’s mom asked him why he’s not yet good at speaking english while Tae improved and Yoongi said Tae’s only memorizing the sentences.
Yoongi’s doormat is a cat that raises his middle finger with a ""GO AWAY"" sign. He’s also the only one (in the rapline) who puts a password in his studio door.
They once made Jin eat wasabi as a bet. And Jungkook suddenty blurted out ""OH MAN HOLY SHIT"" in the background.
Do you know that popular GIF of Ryan from Kakaotalk where he's holding a lightstick? Many versions have already been made but it originated from our very own Kim Namjoon. He was the one who photoshopped it and ARMYs followed through.
Official ARMY birthday is July 9, when the fandom name was announced.
Jungkook set an alarm in IKEA during their bon voyage season 1.
Namjoon was once a center in a basketball team.
Jimin was class president for nine years. A fact even the members didn't know until he said so.
Jungkook’s dog Cloud don’t recognize him ㅠㅠ
In a fansign, a fan asked Yoongi about Holly and he just smiled but later on sighed and said he misses Holly.
Hoseok almost left BTS even before debuting and Namjoon had to convince him to stay because Jungkook wouldn’t stop crying.
Jimin heard noises coming from the kitchen and went to see what it was and saw Jungkook crying because he misses his mom.
Yoongi is mostly asleep on back stage because he sleeps late making songs.
Yoongi’s underground rapper name before was Gloss. This was like an older name I think.
Namjoon’s underground rapper name was Runch Randa.
Tae wanted to be a farmer before because his grandparents had a farm and he wanted to help them.
Jin briefly lived in Australia during his elementary days.
Taehyung and Jimin had an argument about putting trashbins in their rooms.
PS.
I editted #29 it’s actually Australia (I previously wrote New Zealand, I confused him with Namjoon ㅠㅠ)
I also editted #5: Tae’s parents called him different nicknames, I previously just wrote one which is honey bear).
#30 is also editted, I remembered it wrong, I’m sorry. Here is the source:

Seriously? Haven’t you heard this:
This:

Or this?
If you still believe that BTS’ vocal line is not good enough for your standards, then I’m sorry, but you don’t know what real talent is sweetheart.
2. Shipping K-Pop idols needs to stop!
I honestly don’t really mind shipping, I only find it insulting if someone abuses a Kpop idol’s sexuality or writes fanfics that involve certain attributes that are highly inappropriate or rude. Shipping idols because of their chemistry is fine, just don’t take it to another level.
3. [Insert Kpop idol or group here] is/are the kings/queens of the K-Pop industry!
I believe that there aren’t any groups or idols in Kpop that are the superior group because lots of groups are very talented. I feel that when people say that, for example: “BigBang are the kings of Kpop!” that kind of insults other groups who deserve the same amount of praise and are as talented as BigBang.
4. Fan.Wars.
People say how they absolutely despise fanwars as an unpopular opinion, but honestly, it’s not. I’d say that the majority of a fan base for a Kpop group does not like fan wars in the slightest, so stop saying that “fanwars are stupid and need to be stopped!” is an unpopular opinion, because it’s really not.
That’s it for today, thanks for reading!

30,"I am not ARMY, probably not even an EXO-L per say but I do prefer EXO over BTS. I have no problem with BTS as a group at all. I actually enjoy some of their songs very much (Dimple/Illegal being my favourite) and have purchased an album because of this. In general; however, I just prefer EXO’s style of music.
I was not big into BTS’s older hip-hop style and their newer so called, ‘westernised’ music, doesn’t fit my tastes either.
I generally prefer vocal dominant songs over rap-heavy ones. EXO has more Winter Albums and songs focusing on their undeniably strong and beautiful vocal line.
In terms of dances, most of BTS’s members dance well; however, whilst they are strong performers, I don’t find their choreography particularly memorable. I tend to find EXO has a point move at the chorus which is memorable and iconic to the point I can picture it when I hear the song.
Visually, I prefer EXO but This is not to say that BTS is not a bunch of good-looking guys, I often see pictures of . At the end of the day this is all just personal preference, there’s no way to factually say one group is better than the other.
Below we have some of the best looking men of BTS and EXO, it’s not wrong to have an order of perceived attractiveness (or even find some of them not attractive). We’re visual creatures, we have thoughts, it’s okay to have and voice opinions. (EXO Sehun - EXO Suho - BTS V - BTS Jin)
I have absolutely nothing against the boys of BTS, I actually have much respect for them and their hard-work. They have been a huge part in internationalising K-Pop, although it seems many people are just ARMY nowadays, there are many Multi-Fandom Stans also who were introduced to K-Pop through them.
In my limited experience, I found my ARMY friends to be quick to place all blame on EXO-L, which is not fair also. There are conflicts, and that’s okay. Dialogue is great, but just saying ‘EXO is ugly’ or ‘BTS is untalented’ is not productive. Saying ‘J-Hope is a wayy better dancer than ___’ or some other mindless opinion of the like also may cause some turmoil as there is no backing to the statement and instead of just complimenting and praising J-Hope’s amazing dancing, they’re instead dragging ___ into it needlessly.
I feel like nowadays people are sensitive to the point if on a BTS video someone posted ‘I prefer Monster’, they will have fire thrown at them. It’s okay to have opinions like this, but sometimes it’s more productive to go to the Monster video and comment positively there.
There is no way to say for a fact one group is better than the other, so it’s important we form our own opinions and always think and research for ourselves. Just because we have preferences doesn’t mean we should hate on the other side. Instead, if we focus on what we do enjoy.

31,"I’ll answer this on behalf of how most of my korean friends view them and Kpop in general. I have several Korean friends who aren’t really into Kpop, and truthfully they don’t care about the genre itself hahaha. Alright, so frankly, before 2018, they, and most koreans I have conversed with in their church don’t even know of BTS.
To be practically honest, even groups like EXO, BigBang, Girls Generation, those kpop groups are like a huge irk topic to most koreans who aren’t teens. They view idol music as bizarre and a quick trend. (One of my korean friends even go as to so much find some music videos cringy) kpop music doesn’t have anything good to offer in their point of view and even consider it as a weird misconception for foreigners in terms of the visuals of the general korean public (especially males,)
Which is why it is actually surreal kind of feeling that jumping into 2018, my korean friends would message me randomly during the day about how BTS are charting number 1 on Billboard, being on western talkshows and selling out US stadiums. I recall one night even, my friend Jee Son (not her full name or real name) just sent me a link of RM’s UN speech.
Her: I don’t give a fuck about BTS/Kpop, but their message in UN was deep.
Me: Wooow you saw this?
Her: Many of us in the office saw it, it’s actually bringing a bit of pride to us Koreans too because its a good message.
Overall, if you ask any random person in Korea if they know BTS, you won’t hear about what music they like of the group, but rather what major headlining news they achieved.
Comparing to how kpop is viewed, BTS became more like a better topic for them because they can list down their achievements beyond their music.

32,"Here are some tips for you:
Stop thinking that all Korean dudes look like the guys from BTS
Don’t ever leave comments such as ‘Oppa <3’ or ‘Noona <3’ on the Instagram accounts of idols
Don’t go Yoboseyo when someone calls you, just…don’t
Stop fantasizing as if Korea is some magical place where everyone looks like Jin and rides on a unicorn - their society, just like any other society, has some serious issues from racism to high rates of suicide, depression and over-competitiveness (I also believe that the soaring incidence of cosmetic surgery in the country is an alarming statistic)
Respect their culture without appropriating or imitating it
If your heart begins to flutter the moment you read the words ‘Made in Korea’ on a plastic lunchbox or an aloe vera gel, you’re probably on your way to becoming a Koreaboo so please abort mission right there and then
If you have started to make extreme slurpy sounds while consuming instant noodles or have begun to use a pan cover as an alternative to a plate, then kindly abort mission once again
Have a solid and clear-cut reason WHY you want to learn Korean - so you want to learn it so that you can understand lyrics to K-pop songs? well, there’s nothing wrong with that. Do you want to learn it because you would like to travel to Korea one day? there’s nothing wrong with that either. Do you want to learn it because you plan on marrying one of the BTS oppas? STOP JUST STOP, ABORT MISSION ASAP.
I must confess that in the midst of liking Korean entertainment I unknowingly and involuntarily began to engage in at least one of the above actions till I realized how cringey I was being. I stopped immediately and so should anyone with an ounce of sense about respecting cultures.

33,"Not gonna put pictures because I don’t think I have the patience for that.
BlackPink - I think they’re great, and really pretty. However, I don’t understand the hype around them. Rose’s voice has a nice quality to it, but she also hasn’t really demonstrated any particular vocal skill, so I think people definitely overrate her when they say “omg she’s so good at singing” when she’s literally only shown she can sing with a nice tone (which you’re born with), and in tune (which any singer should be). Lisa… is fine, but again, the hype is ridiculous. Jisoo and Jennie are also super pretty but there’s nothing much special about them apart from “yay they can sing well and dance well and be an idol well” in my opinion. They’re freaking cute in their vlives and their interactions are adorable, but yeah. Their clothes are quite similar and their concepts sound quite similar for whatever they do, so I’m not particularly on the hype train for them, much like group 2…
Twice - I have… less good things to say about them, tbh. They’re all decent at singing (it’s not like they’re horrible - they’re idols, after all), and they’re all decent at dancing. They all look very different, which I believe is part of their charm. I’m hesitant to believe they’re extraordinarily popular from all the negative comments I see about them all the time, but it seems like they’re doing really well in terms of albums and music sold, which I personally don’t get. When you compare their songs with other groups’ songs, you can see that their songs lack a lot of the layering that other groups’ songs have; there’s just not as much depth. Additionally… well… yeah. Their concepts have been basically the same, so much like the first one, their songs kind of all blur together for me. So yes, I believe Twice is overrated too.
Wanna One - Well, they have a lot to improve on. Honestly, that’s all I have to say. I get that they’re super popular because they were literally produced by Koreans who watched Produce 101 Season 2, but they feel overrated to me because I don’t believe their talent really matches up. Jaehwan, Daehwi, maybe. The others I feel like have an area they were really good at, or their faces, or their personality, or something like that, that got them chosen. Also, their songs lack that kind of nice layering, much like the second group I mentioned (you know, where there are ad libs, other instruments layered, high notes, etc in the background in appropriate areas, so it doesn’t sound like they only had one line of vocals in the producing process).

34,"Originally Answered: Can an African become a K-pop idol?
No. There was huge deal once about an African in a K-pop group who got kicked out after debut. I'd say give up.
If you're an African girl or boy who wants to become a K-pop idol, there's probably a 0 to 1 percent chance of becoming an idol. Unless of course, you're slender, tall, incredibly pretty, and have undeniable talent. But if you have all these qualities, you'd have a much better success rate in America or Africa.
There's also the thing about fans. Korea doesn't really like people who are of different race, but if you have a completely different skin color as well (remember K-Pop likes to whitewash), dark skin color is shamed.
This is different with native Koreans though. There are Korean K-pop idols who have darker skin (Kai, from EXO is a good example), but even then it can only be called a tan. Some Hispanics and Middle Eastern people with much darker skin aren't usually accepted.
Also, take into account the difference in facial structure. Sure, there are idols who are Thai, Chinese, and Japanese, but they usually all have something that makes them stand out. For example, Lay from EXO writes, composes, and produces all his songs, as well as translates them. He's also arguably one of the best dancers in the K-Pop industry.
If you're not an incredibly unique, lighter skinned African with undeniable talent in all areas visual and vocal-wise, maybe even dance related, you probably don't have a chance.
I know this sounds very biased and rude, but I hope this is an eye opener. Not anyone can be a Korean idol, this is true speaking only about skill level. If you're not light skinned and attractive, there isn't much a chance in the Korean industry.

35,"OMG!!! Your request just made me blush!!! So honored… (if you are not related, no worries. Just two crack heads loving each other).
RM-JK We already have a hint of what it would be like in “Waste it on me”. Both have great interest in collaboration and are good English speakers. JK beautiful voice and his encouragement to RM to explore his singing side (“Fools” as a fine example) will give us great songs and maybe a new side to a singing RM or rapping JK… Artistic wise
RM-JIMIN This one would be pretty interesting because I just love how soft Namjoon goes for Jimin and I bet Jimin will help RM to explore his dancing side and will get as pay off so much production advise from him. I would love to see them in performance MV only for dancing to the song they produced - sorry but I'm so soft in my inside - and see Jimin encouraging the contemporary side of RM dance. 11/10 will watch that MV… Artistic-Chemistry level
V-HOPE I feel that this collaboration is ever to happen we will have something out of the box. V unique perspective when writing and soulful voice along with great Hope’s metaphors and crazy noises will lead us to a whole new level. And also the visual and MV concept will be so smoked out… Artistic level
JIN-JIMIN I would love to see them in a whole different thing. As hosts in a TV program. Those two get along so damn well that I feel jealous sometimes. Their program would be super hilarious but yet will address topics that might not others dare to speak and still in a respectful way… Popularity/Chemistry level
SUGA-JIMIN Aww… this is the utopia I'm dreaming of! Yoongi insane genius producing level will be so hyped if Jimin is next to him in the process. He feeds him with such charming energy that it will be an overload of cuteness the behind cameras. Chimmy will learn and grow in musical production because I bet my lungs, Suga will follow his pace. And we will get more “Tony Montana” songs like and I love Jimin’s husky voice rude side… Artistic-Chemistry-Popularity level
Jejeje… you know me girl!!! (Shout out to @Alexandra Miminis) Completely biased but still love all my brothers-in-law. Which do you think would be good collaboration? Let me know in the comments.
