It is not how a Sushi Chef is intended. Each step in making Nigiri is carefully thought out and designed to achieve a perfect taste in your mouth. Therefore if you dip the rice into the soy sauce, you may not achieve the taste the Sushi Chef intended.
In other words, it is not how the Chef would like you to eat Nigiri.
Long Answer
For the sake of this discussion, we'll look at the making and the design of Maguro, Tuna Nigiri.
Here are the steps I would take to make Maguro Nigiri.
1. Slicing a piece Maguro
Mainly, there are three different kinds of Maguro for Sushi; Bluefin, Big Eye and Yellowfin Tuna. They all taste different, and each part of the fish tastes different. Belly has more fat content than the back and the tail. This means I must cut each part in different length and thickness. For example, I would cut O-Toro (fattiest belly) very thin, thinner than back meat because a thick belly piece would taste overwhelming from the fat. It requires experienced eye and taste bud of a Sushi Chef to determine how to cut a piece of Maguro for nigiri.
2. Applying wasabi
I think wasabi goes well with Maguro. In fact, wasabi tastes better with Maguro than any other fish. (it's my personal opinion, as well as most of the Sushi Chefs I've worked with in the past seventeen years in California. Just as a reference, Jiro Ono said the same thing, too :)
So, I would apply more wasabi to a Maguro Nigiri than Hamachi Nigiri. In other words, an experienced Sushi Chef would apply a different amount of wasabi to a Nigiri, based on the type of fish and part of the fish. I would apply more wasabi to Toro than regular Maguro. Wasabi's aroma is wonderful creating a great harmony with the taste of Maguro.
3. Forming Rice
Based on the size and the thickness of the Maguro I sliced, I would estimate how much Sushi Rice I would need to form a nigiri, as I imagine how the slice of Maguro would taste. After applying wasabi on the piece of Maguro, I would form rice applying pressure. Ideally, a perfectly formed rice should have some tiny pockets of air inside. At the same time, each grain of the rice should stay intact. The reason for the air pockets is so that when you put Nigiri in your mouth, the rice will spread apart inside, releasing the flavor of rice vinegar, sugar, salt and sweetness and Umami.
(A MRI Image of Nigiri, by Jiro Ono. There are some air pockets around each grain of rice. This is considered as a perfectly executed Nigiri. Mine doesn’t even come close to this one. Sigh.)
4. Applying soy sauce on the piece of Maguro
The final step is to apply a thin coat of Soy Sauce on the top piece of Maguro, using a brush. Wasabi, Maguro and Soy Sauce create a perfect balance of taste and aroma. Soy Sauce erases the nice aroma of Wasabi, so just a small appropriate amount on the fish side is good enough. (note that not all sushi chefs season the nigiri with Soy Sauce before they serve them.)
These are the main steps in making Maguro Nigiri.
Each step aims to achieve a perfect balance of taste and aroma. Everything is carefully calculated and designed.
Thus, this is what will happen when you dip the rice part of your Nigiri into the soy sauce.
1. Rice will fall apart before you put it in your mouth
When you dip the rice into soy sauce, it will quickly absorb soy sauce and starts to fall apart, before you can put into your mouth. As mentioned above, Sushi Chef intended the rice to spread apart in your mouth, not on the soy plate, therefore, what you will taste, will be different from what the chef wanted you to taste. Even if you managed to put Nigiri into your mouth without losing a grain of rice, rice will have too much soy sauce, which, will change the flavor balance of the Nigiri.
2. Kill the aroma of Wasabi
Too much soy sauce in the Shari, Sushi Rice will kill the nice aroma of wasabi applied under the piece of Maguro. Remember the Chef's intention of applying more wasabi to Maguro? That will be in vain.
3. Rice will taste different
Sushi Rice is seasoned with Rice Vinegar, Salt and Sugar (some chefs do not use sugar). Soaking the rice side of Nigiri will alter the taste of Shari, which, again, is not what the Chef intended.
So, when you dip the rice into the soy sauce, you are saying;
A) I don't know or care about how the chef intended my Nigiri to taste.
B) I am aware of how the chef intended and designed my Nigiri to taste. Knowing this, I would like to eat it in my way.
Is it inappropriate or wrong to eat that way? I feel the answer depends on the chef. I would not say it is wrong. As I stated above, it's not how Nigiri is designed.
That being said, in conclusion, I would like to say this: Eat your sushi the way you like to eat it. (Kaz Matsune's answer to What's the correct way to eat sushi?)
Through years of my experience, I came to understand that people are free to eat their Sushi in the way that please them. I came to understand that is the best way to eat anything. I came to understand that each person has different taste bud. I came to understand though some people say Natto (fermented soy beans) smell so foul, yet they love the smell of Blue Cheese. I came to understand that just because I love the taste of Uni, that doesn't mean my clients would love them, too. I came to understand that my opinion as a Sushi Chef matters, but it is not final. I came to understand that I am not always right about Sushi.
If a Sushi Chef gets offended for his customer for not eating his Nigiri the way he intended, that is his ego, not respecting his customer, or thinking he is better than his customer.
I came to understand both the chef and his customers are equal. If I fail to respect my customers, my customers will not respect me either.
A customer should not obey a chef automatically and a chef should not obey his customer automatically either. Sushi Chefs are no better than you, non-chefs, the customers. We know more about Sushi, but that does not make us better. Our job as a Chef, I think, is to guide you and serve you, not force you to change your mind or the way you eat Sushi.
The way to eat Nigiri is just a proposal, an idea, a suggestion and it's up to you to take it or leave it.

1,"Most unagi served outside Japan is precooked, vacuum-packed and frozen. Not all the brands (by far) actually use the river eel species that’s the “real unagi”. The wild one is endangered and the farmed unagi is in high demand in Japan itself. A lot of of the eel served as unagi kabayaki is a similar species farmed notably in China.
The restaurants that do serve river eel kabayaki-style outside Japan actually use local live eels to make it that aren’t, strictly speaking, unagi. It’s more common for these restaurants to be yakitori-style joints rather than sushi bars, though I’ve eaten some “homemade” kabayaki at a few more high end places.
Anago is a species indigenous to Japan. It’s in high demand, and like other fish from Japan there are quotas and restrictions. Restaurants that serve it get it alive (eels deteriorate quickly). It’s a fragile flesh. It would not travel well once cooked, and I suspect it wouldn’t fare well frozen. Restaurants that do serve anago outside Japan usually have a private importation license for live fish. Most of them are on the expensive side.

2,"If it's the green toothpaste that is served as 'wasabi' in 99% of the Western world, it's because you should only use a little, if any. In quantity, it steps all over the flavor of good sushi.
Some places will give you huge amounts. I saw one place recently that dispensed paste 'wasabi' with a large melon-baller…making chunks about the size of my thumb (and I've got big hands). They do this because lots of spicy green gunk covers the smell of slightly off fish, and desensitizes you to the fact that the ‘crab’ is really Krab Brand Ocean Product.
On the other hand, if you are at a place where they give you real wasabi, freshly cut by a true master, dipped gently in a mix of rice wine vinegar and secrets, then schmeared with the back edge of the knife before being placed in a lovely ceramic bowl; the reason they only give you little is simple. Real wasabi is bloody expensive.
There's exactly one place I know of in this state that serves real wasabi. It comes by special order from Japan, and is treated with the same respect given to real truffles, caviar, and foie gras. It's rare, and beautiful.
Also anyone serving the real stuff is probably serving sushi that needs no additional spice, wasabi or otherwise. In the last three visits to my local amazing place, I've gone through less than an ounce of real wasabi, and have not touched the soy sauce at all…. It doesn't need it, and would be an insult to the art.

3,"First, ceramic knives aren't that sharp.  They're fine when they're new, but they aren't sharper than a polished knife.  Sushi knives also tend to only cut soft things.  They cut through soft flesh, dry seaweed, and soft vegetables.  They don't wear down very quickly, so even if you were bad at sharpening your knife, it would still stay sharp for quite some time.

One of the bigger issues is how fragile the knife actually is.  Those things shatter easily, and it just isn't worth the risk.  Chefs take care of their knives, but they still could get knocked off a table, or have something banged on them.  That ceramic knife is probably going to break in a professional kitchen.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it just isn't a proper commercial product.

Another issue is size.  If you look at the more expensive sushi knives, they are very long.  You could make a ceramic knife of the same dimensions, but the longer the knife is, the more likely it will crack.  It just isn't worth it.  The knife needs to be long too.  You can slice through sushi rolls just fine with a 6"" - 8"" knife, but if you get your hands on a tuna loin, you want to have a long knife to have proper slices through the meat.  If you don't have a long enough knife, you're going to have to use a sawing motion, and you're more likely to have imperfections on your tuna.  You want one even cut, not multiple cuts.  With such expensive product there is just no point in using an improper tool.

Professionally speaking, there isn't any benefit to a ceramic knife.  I tried to use one for cutting lettuce, because theoretically that is ideal.  My properly sharpened 10"" Misono left less bruising on the edges of the lettuce.  I made that knife my small service knife, and I came back to my station one day to find it cracked on the floor.  It just happens sometimes, and the guy who broke it apologized, but had it been a metal knife that wouldn't have happened.

Also, I can fix a bent tip.  I can't do anything with ceramic shards.

I've seen professional chefs use those ceramic knives as travel knives.  They leave their expensive knives at home, and use a ceramic one that they can afford to lose in a foreign kitchen.  One chef even gave us the knife as a parting gift.  That knife lasted several months before we found it cracked in the sheath because someone closed the drawer too quickly.

I'm not a knife collector, but I do have quite a few.  One from 2002, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2013, and I don't plan on getting rid of any of them anytime soon.  Each one cost between $40, and $200.  I think total investment is less than $600.  They should all last me another 20 years.  I can't even imagine what 20 years of ceramic knives would cost me.

There is a place for ceramics though.  I am a big fan of Kyocera's ceramic peelers.  They are fantastic.  Standard peelers aren't as sharp, and they react to a lot of food.  Standard peelers also don't last all that long.  I go through about 1 per year.  If I am careful, I can get more than a year out of a ceramic peeler, but they do break.  At $10 vs $1 to $5, I consider this a reasonable investment, and benefit relative to cost.

Ceramic knives are fine for home use.  Get a new one every year, and you probably have a sharp knife for years.  Most houses don't even have a sharp knife, so that's a huge step up.

For the most part, Ceramic knives are a gimmick.

8,"We don’t call that “all you can eat,” as that would imply one price for unlimited food. Conveyor places in Japan are pay-by-the-plate. They tend to be reasonably priced. You should take no more than two dishes at a time, and finish them before you take any more. Take your time, have some tea, “let it hit bottom,” and also wait for some different things to appear on the belt. It usually takes a half an hour or so before all of the usual selections appear on the belt. It would be impolite to take more than you can eat, and it would be impolite to eat until you’re stuffed, so stop when you have a comfortably-full-but-not-stuffed feeling, and maybe the family will go for ice cream afterward.

9,"Edit (July 4, 2016)
So, I did some research after my original answer and guess what? I was wrong about a ceramic knife can be easily chipped.
My answer was based on my experience from ten to twelve years ago and since then, the technology in ceramic knives have advanced, apparently.
Kyocera makes ceramic knives, including Yanagi Sashimi knife whose blade is flexible and durable, eliminating the chance of being chipped. Here are the videos:
Bending Test:
Drop Test:
Since I have not yet used or seen and touched this ceramic knife, I am not 100% sure how durable it is. However, I can say for sure that my answer to the question is different now.
So, the reason for the sushi chefs to not to use a ceramic knife, is because, most of them, myself included, believe the ceramic knives are unsuitable. Like me, perhaps, they are stuck in the old notion that a traditional steel yanagi knive is better than the ceramic one. I am not saying that a ceramic Yanagi knife is better than a Steel one. I am saying that it’s their belief which is preventing them from being open minded.
Old Answer:
Over my sixteen years as a sushi chef, I've only seen one sushi chef and one non-sushi chef with a ceramic knife. They both told me the same thing, as pointed out their beautiful ceramic knife: They chip easily.
The sushi chef who showed me his ceramic knife told me this: ""Yes, I bought it because they said it is very sharp, light and beautiful, but you know what? I cracked it after few days in the kitchen. I must handle it really carefully and in a professional kitchen, especially when we get busy, it's very hard to keep a constant eye on the ceramic knife and pay attention.”
If you ask me, and you are welcome to ask other sushi chefs, as well as any chefs, and I bet most of them would say the same thing about a ceramic knife not practical in a professional environment. The chance of the ceramic knife being hit by ingredients, equipment or being dropped is so high (because we use our knives every day for 8 hours that in the kitchen), for me, I'd rather want to keep using my steel knives. (Even the blade of a steel knife can be chipped)

10,"As others have mentioned, so-called Sushi-grade and Sashimi-Grade fish are commercial terms, not official ones.
That being said, those terms are frequently used at retail stores, by fishmongers and chefs in the US, which, I think make them general terms.
The bottom line is this: ""sushi-grade"" and ""Sashimi Grade"" fish mean the fish is suitable for raw consumption.
There are many elements that determine if the fish is suitable for raw consumption.
It's bit complex, so let me explain one by one
Type of fish
There are some fish that is safe to eat raw, and there are some unsafe to eat raw. For example, Yellowfin Tuna, Bigeye Tuna, Bluefin Tuna are all safe to eat raw, while Salmon is not. Spot prawns, aka Ama Ebi, is safe to eat raw, but not white shrimp caught in the Gulf of Mexico.
Freshness of fish
How fresh the fish is, can definitely affect if you can consume it raw, safely. The tricky thing is that, just because the fish is fresh, it does not mean it's tasty. For example, most Suna (not Albacore) needs at least five days to one week of aging, some up to two weeks in the refrigerator and so does Salmon (around five days). Same goes with white fish like Halibut, which takes one week to two weeks to start to have a nice flavor.
So, what many think of ""Fresh"" fish at a sushi bar, is not really ""Fresh"" as you think they are. Those people think fresh as something caught, just-off-the-boat kind of fresh. The fact is that many fish served at Sushi Restaurants are not that fresh in that sense, like off the boat this morning fresh, though, there are certainly many fish that are caught this morning kind of fresh.
The freshness of the fish, to the sushi chefs and fishmongers, is not so much of when it was caught, but rather, how the fish is kept after it's caught. The fish must be properly gutted, cleaned, gills removed, kept on ice immediately after it's caught. These things are more important than when it was caught. You can leave a fresh fish on the boat, under the sun for two hours and it will become unsuitable for raw consumption, even though, the fish is only two hours old.
Contrary, fish like Albacore and Katsuno/Bonito/Skipjack, is the best when it's eaten on the same day, or just-off-the-boat fresh.
Frozen and or cured (treated)
Salmon, if unfrozen, is not suitable for raw consumption because it comes with parasites called Tape-Warm and also some bacteria.
In order to kill parasites, the salmon must be frozen. It gets technical so, I am going to simplify it here by saying you need to freeze it in a commercial freezer for at least 24 hours. At home, you need to freeze it for 7 days to kill the parasites. (you can go to US FDA page to learn more about this).
So, if you see Sashimi Salmon at Supermarket or a sushi restaurant, then, it's likely that the Salmon was frozen previously and thawed.
The exception to this is that there are some farm-raised parasite-free Salmon, which requires no freezing for raw consumption. I have no information as to which Salmon fits under this category, so if interested, you need to talk to the fishmonger or the salmon farm.
Most Saba/Mackerel is unsuitable for raw consumption and freezing does not do it. It must be treated or cured and the method is called ""Shime"" in Japanese. You need to cure it in salt for about 2 hours or so, then soak it in vinegar for 15-30 minutes or so, then it becomes OK for raw consumption.
There are, however, some rare type of Saba you can eat raw, caught in a specific region of Japan, during a specific time of the year. Seki•Saba, or so-called Golden Saba is one of them. They must be super fresh, something like less than 8 hours old.

11,"Visit your local Japanese grocery store, if you have one in your area. You'll find plenty of traditional sushi ingredients there besides raw fish.

For example, you can use takuan (pickled radish), kaiware (radish sprouts), or unagi (freshwater eel) as Lex mentioned, just to name a few. You'll also find all the ingredients you'll need to make makimono (rolls), like sushi rice, vinegar, seaweed, bamboo mats for rolling, etc.

If you don't care about tradition, you can always make California Rolls using imitation crab meat. Typically, California Rolls contain ""crab sticks,"" or kani kama, but I'm not sure you can find it at a non-Japanese grocery store. However, a lot of sushi bars are using ""crab flakes"" instead these days. They squeeze out any excess moisture from the imitation crab meat (after thawing it first), mince it up using either a knife or a food processor, and then mix it with mayo to create a ""crab mix."" This is then used with julienne cucumbers and sliced avocado for your typical California Roll.

Keep in mind though that if you do decide to make sushi using raw fish, a Japanese grocery store is your best bet for getting quality ingredients. I wouldn't recommend a local grocery chain, such as Whole Foods. Not only is the quality uncertain, but the cuts aren't always appropriate for nigiri or sashimi anyways. Tuna, for example, is often sold in grocery chains as steaks rather than loins, which is what you need in order to successfully cut nigiri and sashimi slices.

At any rate, check out your local Japanese grocery store. Just browse the aisles and you'll find a number of traditional and delicious ingredients for all types of sushi.

12,"Dan Japanese Restaurant on Broadway -- 2511 W Broadway, if you're seeking a more traditional sushi experience.

This is based on the following:

* Portion size similar to what you would see in Japan (not monster size all-you-can-eat pieces that you get at third-rate restaurants)
* Freshness of fish and cutting style (e.g. farmed Salmon is not an option)
* Variety of dishes (good variety of fish year round and willingness to exclude fish not in season)
* Will not serve dishes if they're below chef's stringent standards
* Presentation
* Temperature and quality of rice and other ingredients
* Real Wasabi when available, not reconstituted or pre-packaged Wasabi

Ken San pays remarkable attention to the quality of his food and what comes out of his kitchen. The restaurant is small and reservations are definitely recommended. Going to Dan over Tojo's (which in my mind, is overrated) will save you a bundle and you'll go home satisfied and not feeling ripped off.

If you want to deviate from traditional, Miku in Yaletown where Goldfish (and Circolo and Mangimo) used to be is a truly enjoyable culinary experience. Any other suggestions I make would border on Izakaya fare.

13,"There are many varieties of tuna that appear in sushi: some cooked, some slightly cooked, some cured, some raw. Your question isn’t specific enough to have a specific answer. I’ve included some context below to help.
Traditional Sushi
Tuna is a mainstay in traditional Japanese sushi restaurants. Many courses included multiple different types of sushi preparation. None of them are fully cooked. Often, tuna served in sushi is raw. I’ve never seen traditional sushi served with fully heat cooked tuna.
Zuke - A slice of tuna (typically from a lean part of the fish) is marinated in a mixture that includes soy, seaweed, sake, and mirin. This process cures the fish much like a ceviche would. The texture will be firmer, meatier, and take on the flavor of the marinade. This is sometimes diced up and put in a roll or handroll, and often times served as nigiri with a yuzu pepper paste or something else fragrant.
Tataki - A block of tuna is seared on the outside, sometimes seasoned with toasted sesames, and cut into slices, served as an appetizer / sashimi, inside a roll, or rarely, served as nigiri
Aburi - A slice of tuna that’s been torched on the top after made into nigiri. This is typically done with fattier cuts of tuna (chutoro or otoro) to release some of the fat and add a smokey umami to it. Much of this fish will be partially raw.
Sukimi - Scrapings off of the part against the skin, or around the bones of the fish. Typically this is combined with something fragrant (spices, green onions, etc.) and served in a roll or a handroll. In western countries, this is described as a tuna tartare. This is almost always raw.
Westernized Sushi
In less traditional sushi restaurants (fusion, modern, fast food, etc.) Spicy Tuna is a staple roll found in most sushi restaurants. Though recipes vary greatly, they have their roots in Sukimi sushi handrolls but with more spice and typically served as a regular roll.
I’ve also seen sushi made with sushi that was cooked and mixed like a regular tuna fish sandwich tuna.

14,"Short Answer: Go’s Mart, Canoga Park.
******************** Long Answer ********************
I was working at a sushi restaurant in Hollywood and my coworker, Ken told me about this sushi bar. Ken was younger than I was and had more experience being a sushi chef. He was working only two nights a week and the rest of the time, he was a guitarist in the band. Ken started his training in Japan, working at a sushi restaurant in Tokyo as an apprentice, so he knew more about the traditional sushi techniques.
One day, Ken told me about Go’s Mart. All the sushi chefs at the bar were talking about a newly opened restaurant in Hollywood. Quite often, we gossiped about other restaurants and other sushi chefs to find out what others were doing, keeping up with the trends, special menus, type of fish other people were getting and so on. After all, it was the time before the social media, back in 2002.
“Go-san is great. It’s a tiny place - only four seats at the sushi bar and a couple of tables. It's my favorite place in the whole of LA. I think it's the best Sushi bar in town and the best-kept secret. Not very many people know about it. Only those who love sushi go there. In fact, it’s not really a sushi restaurant. It’s more like a fish market that serves sushi. Nothing fancy there. If you see it from outside, you will not think it's a great sushi restaurant. Everything Go-san makes is fantastic. Oh, I want to go there again. Go-san is very nice, too. He is gentle and friendly. You should make a reservation. He will treat you good.
I immediately called Go’s Mart and made a reservation. I decided to go there on Sunday with my friend Sen, who was also a sushi chef. We knew Sunday was not exactly the best day to go sushi restaurant because fish suppliers were closed on Sundays. Knowing this, we decided to go to Go's Mart because for one, we believed in Ken and secondary, if Go-san could serve us great sushi even on Sunday evening, it meant that his sushi would be even better on regular nights.
I looked at the address of Go's Mart: 22330 Sherman Way C12, Canoga Park, CA 91303. Canoga Park? I needed to check on my Thomas Guide - a map of greater Los Angeles area owned by virtually every resident of the city. Everyone kept at least one copy in their car.
We drove about an hour from Hollywood to Canoga Park. I was living in Santa Monica at that time and unless I had some business to do, (which I did not), Canoga Park was not a place for me to go. As a matter of fact, for the past ten years, I've never been there. It's hot, a suburb of Los Angeles and lots of corner shopping malls and suburban houses, which is exactly where Go’s Mart sits"" at the end of corner shopping mall with a big plastic sign. Nothing stylish. Nothing extraordinary. Just does its job of telling the name of the place. If we did not know about it, we would never put our foot inside. How could we have known? After all, in Canoga Park? Not in Beverly Hills like Urasawa is?
We parked right in front of the Mart and walked in through the door. The inside of the store had a small refrigerator with some fish and the sushi counter with bar stools: only four of them. And there were two tables with two chairs each. It was like walking into a mom and pop ice cream parlor in a small town, somewhere in Iowa. Then, behind the sushi bar was tall skinny Japanese man with short hair and rigid looking face. We figured it was Go-san. He did not like friendly, I thought, at least, at first sight.
""Umm, we made a reservation, for two people, under Kaz, "" I said to the man.
""Oh, yes, are you Kaz-san? We were expecting you. Here, please have a seat.""
""Thank you.""
We sat at the bar. Even though we knew the place was nothing fancy, we were bit anxious because we never been to a place like this before, and have great sushi. I think we were anxious because we knew it was going to be a great surprise.
""Omakase, please.""
""OK,"" Go-san said.
""Anything you cannot eat?""
""We can eat everything,"" I said.
""I understand. Thank you,"" Go-san said.
""I work with Ken, the sushi chef. He told us about you, and that's why we came here today.""
""Ken?"" Go-san thought it for a second. ""Oh, yes, the sushi chef. He's been here a couple of times. You work with him, huh? Well, today's Sunday, so we are a bit short of some fish, you know. The fish supplier is closed today. If you came on Tuesday, it would have been better, but, oh well.""
""We'll come on Tuesday the next time. Today was the only day we could come. When Ken told me about you, we wanted to come here as soon as possible,"" I said to Go-san.
""I see. It's not a problem,"" Go-san smiled.
I think that was the first time I saw Go-san smile since we walked into the restaurant. I felt relieved to him smile. I suppose I was nervous because Go-san had an intense look.
We ordered a bottle of Sapporo and started drinking.
""Here is an appetizer - Nasu Dengaku, baked Japanese eggplant with some sweet miso. It should go well with your beer.""
""Thank you.""
The eggplant was sweet and moist, just off the oven. It was matching perfectly with the sweet miso paste.
""This is delicious,"" I said. ""What kind of Eggplant is this?""
It was round like a small ball.
""It's Kamo Nasu, or Kyoto Eggplant,"" Go-san explained.
A good sushi chef can make a good sashimi or nigiri. One of the signs of a great sushi chef is a cooked dish he/she makes. We immediately knew, judging from the taste of the eggplant, Go-san's sushi would be superb.
Using his Yanagi-ba, Go-san made two slices of white fish from the fish case. He picked up one piece of the fish in his right hand, then grabbed a small amount of sushi rice with his left hand. He moved slowly and squeezed the fish and rice together, gently and firmly.
""Here is Hirame.""
We noticed it looked slightly different from the hirame we make. We were used to serving it with momiji•oroshi, grated daikon radish, and ponzu sauce.
""What's this red topping?""
""Oh, it's Goji berry.""
""Goji berry?""
""Yes, try it. It goes well with white fish.""
I never thought of using Goji berry for nigiri. Sure, Go-san was right. It was brilliant.
""Here is Toro.""
Again, Go-san's Toro looked different from the ones we used to see.
""This Toro is fantastic. Where is this from?""
""It's from Spain. These are farm raised.""
""I did not know they can farm raise bluefin tuna?""
""Well, it's kind of farm raised. They catch the adult bluefins and surround them in an inside of a large fishing net in the ocean. Then, they feed the tuna and let them grow until they are nice and fatty. So, it's half farm raised, not 100% farm raised yet.""
(Note: In 2015, Kinki University in Japan announced that they have succeeded in farm raising bluefin tuna until then, it was considered impossible to farm raise bluefin.)
""Everything is fantastic,"" I said.
""Thank you.""
We had some Kohada, Saba, Uni. It was nothing like we've tasted before.
In fact, it was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted.
One of the most striking differences about Go-san's sushi was a wide variety of toppings he used: Goji Berry, Gold Leaf, and Yuzu Peel. HIs finishing touches, as small as they may seem, were what distinguished his sushi from others and made our dining experience more than just fish on top of vinegared rice.
It was mesmerizing to watch Go-san made his nigiri - very calmly, yet energetically, as if he was putting all the effort into one tiny piece of nigiri. He made sure he took enough time, which was the opposite of what we were used to. All the sushi chefs I worked with considered being ""fast handed"" as one of the skills of being a great sushi chef.
Apparently, Go-san had his own philosophy of being a sushi chef.
One squeeze at a time, Go-san looked as if he was making a perfect Origami Paper Crane. He was very meticulous.
After the very satisfying sushi dinner, we could not wonder why an exceptional Sushi chef like Go-san would have a restaurant in a remote place like Canoga Park. We thought he could have much bigger, a nicer restaurant in LA and it he would certainly do well, not to say he is doing badly in Canoga Park or anything.
I guess everyone has his place in the universe.

15,"Temaki 手巻き means “handroll” (literally - the characters are te (hand) and maki (roll). Picture of temaki attached! My wife and I would routinely have temaki parties when our kids were tiny and old enough to stand. It was a blast to give the kids a rectangle of dry seaweed (about 4″ x 7″ or 10cm x 17cm) and a big bucket of sushi rice and any kind of ingredients. This is where you can have all sorts of fun. We would go to the farmers market in the morning at get cucumbers, carrots, thin radishes. We’d cook up Japanese-style egg omelettes (tamagoyaki) and slice it into pieces or strips. You can use any kind of sashimi-grade fish. A tiny bit of soy sauce on the side for dipping, and the kids would have a blast.
You can get more Japanese or even less Japanese, and mix it up. One of my favorite temakis of all time is a kimchee-cheese-negi temaki with Korean kimchee, some kind of fun melty cheese (my personal favorite is Gruyere) and negi, which are just green onions- sauteed of course. Spoon a little of that over some rice, wrap it up in seaweed, and you have a creatively spicy treat. You can go nuts with temakis and make anything your heart desires. Now that I live in Kobe, Japan, I like to go for more local foods and raw fishes depending on the season.

16,"すきや橋次郎 Sukiyabashi Jiro's business hours are five hours 30 minutes a day (the sum of lunch and dinner). They have 10 seats for customers. People have to eat sushin 20 minutes (they say) and they pay ¥30,000 each.
If I assume ten seats are full all the time, then Jiro makes ¥30,000 × 10 = ¥300,000 per 20 minutes.
Five hours 30 minutes is 330 minutes. 330 / 20 (minute) = 16.5. 16.5 × ¥300,000 = ¥4,950,000.
So, Jiro earns roughly $43,500.00 per day. [based on the exchange rate as of November 13, 2017]
Remember? I assumed the ten seats are full all the time and customers have to leave in 20 minutes. Sometimes this may not happen. But I can understand that why Jiro's eldest son can drive a Ferrari.

17,"That most sushi is served with fresh and purely raw toppings is a misconception that arose in America (and elsewhere), where the range of fish varieties serve at mid-range sushi places is very limited and happen to be fish served totally raw, like salmon, tuna, albacore etc. with fully cooked eel, shrimp and imitation crab. In mid-range sushi places for masses, the purely raw toppings (not even brushed with sauce) abound because the chefs lack skills or the restaurant botches the job. It’s different at more high end places, whether they serve “fusion” and creative sushi or authentically traditional sushi.
In truth, in the Edo-maezushi tradition, the chef most often than not cures or treats the raw toppings for his nigirizushi in some way. For some of these techniques, that’s enough by the rules of Japanese cuisine to be considered a dressed or marinated dish, not sashimi.
The thing is… sushi isn’t about serving something raw, it’s about pairing the delicately seasoned rice with a topping served at its best, pleasant to chew and with as much as possible umami. Originally (I’m talking about early modern sushi here, not ancient times), it used to be about the products available from the Bay of Edo itself. Before refrigeration, sashimi wasn’t served at food stalls where the pieces just sat there. It meant all the toppings for nigirizushi were rather cured or cooked for preservation. Since after WWII, using sashimi for sushi toppings because technology now allowed it has become very popular, but the preservation techniques are still used a lot because they enhance flavour as well as preserve the fish.
As you’ll see, octopus and shrimp aren’t really the exception.
Salmon eggs are cured in sake and shoyu - and virtually all roe is salted and cured too. Most “blue fish” (the “silvery things” as it’s called) like mackerel, ibodai (true butterfish, not escolar), kohada, sardines and sometime even sawara are cured in salt and vinegar (or occasionally with yuzu). North Americans tend to see shime saba as something “raw”, but Japanese or even Europeans with their own cured fish traditions make the distinction.
The delicate and pricey white fish are most often cured in kombu and salt to bring out their umami, and their skin when not removed is most often cooked, either with boiling water or in a more contemporary way, torched. Other fish are grilled on the surface then iced (tataki). Even for sashimi assortments it’s considered a bit boring to feature only raw pieces, so for contrast of texture as well as flavour the chef will often include treated pieces, for example very lightly boiled cuttlefish, than can be cut like noodles, or scarred and rolled with or without nori. Another technique, for white fish like seabass, is to lightly coat them in starch before pouring boiling water over the pieces that are immediately thrown in an ice bath.

It’s now pretty common to torch lightly the flesh of some fish - like toro, buri, kanpachi etc. for added umami and an interesting contrast of temperatures, even in Japan. Tuna is often simply aged these days (for well over a week), but it used to be cured in shoyu and not served raw.
Quite a few delicacies are even fully cooked. Anago is an example (and unagi, in Western sushi places) and abalone.
And that bring me to shrimps/prawns: ebi. Those are considered tricky. To be served raw very safely, they need to be very fresh, pretty much kept alive in a tank. After rigor mortis sets in the texture isn’t good and you need to wait until it’s over, by which time it needs to be cooked. Thing is though… only some species naturally have enough umami to be very interesting served that way, and those are mostly available only in Japan, except at high end places abroad.

Over time after death, amino-acids (umami) are released, enhancing the flavour - many species of shellfish are very boring and bland unless allowed to “age”. Some chefs prefer to serve high quality “aged” ebi, cooked as they deem them not interesting enough raw.
Others who are able to get the most umami-full species like Botan-ebi alive or very very fresh serve them raw (but usually marinated in some way, or enhanced with an umami-full topping like caviar or uni) - but many species are fairly boring and best avoided for sushi, cooked or raw (that sadly include most shrimps served on sushi in North America and Europe). Some chefs, even among the best like Jiro, think even the best botan-ebi are best cooked and marinated.
Chefs in some higher-end restaurants in and outside Asia don’t put them on their menus except when they’re able to source some pretty specific ones.
Except… North America used to be very short of good and reliable sourced toppings for sushi, and cooked ones were less frightening and exotic to squeamish Americans. Chefs could rarely get ama-ebi and botan-ebi alive to serve raw, and they grossed out many customers when they did. They served mostly cooked shrimps. As sushi’s popularity spread, quality went down with the prices. More and more you found cooked shrimps that were of cheaper and inferior (less tasty) species, and more and more the restaurants didn’t even bother marinating them to enhance their umami. Proper “Ebi” sushi, cooked or raw, are a delight, but American sushi has pretty much turned them into the blandest, most boring of “vanilla sushi”.
As for octopus it’s largely the same. Octopus is served raw, but again it needs to be served raw before rigor mortis sets in, or else cooked after it’s passed, so it’s more a speciality restaurant/stall item than an item for most sushi bars. Fresh octopus is common in Japan (though they do import a lot of frozen octopus too). In North America, it’s mostly frozen Mediterranean octopus from Portugal, Spain or North Africa that’s used for sushi (some Japanese chefs hold that octopus from Portugal is best, though most prefer Japanese species).
Octopus is served mostly steamed or boiled for sushi, and in part it’s got to do with enhancing its umami and bringing out its sweetness. For sushi it’s more usually done briefly, so the texture of the flesh doesn’t get too rubbery. Occasionally you’ll find octopus for sushi that has been fully cooked to great tenderness, the way it’s done for octopus for grilling, but it has less of its umami this way.
Many sushi chefs simply think that raw octopus isn’t very interesting. I had it once, during an omakase lunch. The chef had done a kind of gin-an (very thick dashi with kuzu) sauce for it, and served this in a gunkan maki with shiso and a lot of fresh wasabi as the raw octopus is bland. It was pretty “meh”, IMO. Not awful, but not something I’d order à la carte.

Jon Budiwijaya",Dominic Audy,Why are fish-based sushi raw whereas octopus and shrimp sushi aren't?,Sushi
18,"The raw toppings for sushi are handled in different ways. It varies according to fish, to country, to price range and chef/restaurant.
Some areas require that all fish serve raw to customers must be frozen following guidelines of temperature and duration. It’s done in different ways. Some fish are flash-frozen whole on the fishing boat or, once filleted at a transformation plant at port. Other fish are bought fresh by the restaurants and frozen by their care. Typically in mid-range restaurants and even some higher end ones, many fish are bought frozen and already cut into more or less standard “sashimi blocks”. This is often the case with tuna and salmon, and other fat fish that withstand freezing better than the more delicate fish, like hamachi, albacore tuna (and crappy fish like escolar). etc. Beside “food safety”, the practice also helps mid-range restaurants to stay competitive by minimizing losses. They thaw what they’ll need for service, and no more.
Many other countries have much less stringent rules and what is served at sushi bars is a mix of carefully selected fresh fish and a few pre-frozen items. This often varies through the year and depending where the fish is sourced. In Japan, the best tuna are flash-frozen immediately after capture and sold frozen at market, then thawed and cut for wholesale or retail (unless a restaurant or chain buy a whole tuna). Tuna is most often aged, even up to 14 days. Another technique is used to paralyze the living fish on the boat by spiking its spine. It is then kept very cold (but not frozen). It is a high end technique that require skills and is used mostly for more expensive fish (eg: Tai/Madai). The Japanese also offer it more and more for top range fish that gets sold to top sushi bars abroad (that’s why Japanese fish that you couldn’t even find widely on the West Coast ten years ago are now more available in high end places, at least in countries which laws allow fish to be imported this way, like Canada. Here this is done by private importation, must be handled through a fish distributor and require a special importation license. Several top restaurants through the country have those and can serve fresh fish straight from Tsukiji market this way. Jun-I and Park in Montréal have those, notably).
At the restaurants themselves, the process vary from fish to fish and chef to chef. Mid-range, mass market restaurants rarely do any fancy process themselves. Their list of fish is short, and those that are cured like mackerel are often bought pre-made. Octopus is bought pre-cooked (in lower-end restaurants, even pre-sliced). BBQ Eel is also bought pre-cooked. Raw fish is served raw, rarely more than sliced and garnished or not. Preparing sashimi slices from whole fish in this range of restaurants isn’t very common.
Above that range of restaurants, the “real deal” begins and food starts selling for enough money to allow fancier work, closer to authentic higher range sushi bars in Japan. It’s the range in which the chefs, Japanese or not, have real sushi chef training, old school or not. They’re more than competent cooks who can serve raw fish without poisoning customers that you find at the average places.
It becomes far more common for the chefs to work from whole fish rather then pre-cut blocks. The sushi chefs also start to use different techniques for each sushi topping.
Some fish are aged for a few additional days after being caught, to let the rigor mortis phase pass, and to allow post-death amino-acids to develop to the peak point of flavour.
A lot of the silver fish (Mackerel, sardine, kohada, ibodai, sawara and co.) are cured in salt for hours, and then with a rice vinegar mix that can include other ingredients (sugar, kombu, yuzu etc.),
Other fish (often the delicate white fish absent from mid-range sushi places) are lightly cured in salt and then in kombu, to infuse them with more umami and firm them up.
The skin of some fish is softened (so it can be eaten) by cooking it, either by blanching with boiling water or oil, or by torching. Other fish like bonito or albacore are grilled lightly on the surface with the tataki technique. Some toppings are briefly marinated.
After being shaped on a nigiri, some fish are torched. Most toppings in a “real” sushi bar are brushed by the chef with a special sauce that may or not be the same for each fish. They require no additional seasoning (ie: no dipping in soy sauce).

Ask any sushi lover what they like about it and you’re likely to get all sorts of expressive answers. While some will tell you that it’s not much about the food but more of the experience, others will express how much they love their sushi – the combination of flavours and textures. People who “hate” sushi are usually those who have had a bad first experience with it and will no longer dare to try again. Sushi can be intimidating to the novice, so we’ve put together all our sushi tips to come up with this ultimate sushi guide.
1. What is Sushi?
So, you’ve never had sushi before but now you’re ready to try the world’s most popular Japanese food? We’re going to tell you what you’ve been missing and how you should start to navigate the world of this versatile cuisine. Sushi is a way of preparing food that can go from a street-corner cart to the most exclusive establishment. Sushi is a famous Japanese method of cooking and serving food, based on rice, vegetables, egg, and seafood. Sushi is often thought of as simply raw fish and rice, but there are many
varieties of sushi
nowadays, some don’t even fish at all!
What do you need to know about eating sushi?
1. If you like fish (generally), you are going to love sushi.
2. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you can explore more options with cool refreshing veggie based rolls.
3. If you are health conscious or closely watching your diet, sushi is a great meal choice.
2. A Brief History of Sushi
The origins of Sushi are shrouded in the mists of time. It is thought to have originated in ancient China, where people used cooked rice to start a fermentation process to preserve fish. Moving to Japan, this method of preserving and serving fish in rice became popular in the 9th century alongside the adoption of Buddhism, as Buddhists abandoned eating meat and consumed rice, vegetable and small amounts of fish instead. Through the centuries, people adapted and changed the methods of preparing and serving sushi, speeding up the process of fermentation and finally beginning to serve fresh rather than preserved fish. Sushi was also once a food reserved for the elite because of the labour and expense involved in preparing it.
Finally, in the early 19th century, a modern form of sushi was invented by street stall vendor, Hanaya Yoehi in what is now modern-day Tokyo. Rather than fermenting fish in packed salted rice, Yoehi developed a new style of tasty street food by adding vinegar and salt to just cooked rice served with slices of raw fresh fish. Soon, hundreds of other street food vendors began copying Yoehi’s innovation and this style of sushi spread throughout Japan.
In the 1960s, Japanese businessmen living in California imported their favourite food. The first restaurant serving sushi opened in 1966 in Little Tokyo area. For the first time, Americans were able to try sushi and the little Japanese cuisine became widely known. Soon, American-based chefs began to innovate - creating the first Sushi “rolls” and adding untraditional ingredients like avocado and cream cheese. From America,
sushi restaurants started to pop up all around the world, eventually becoming one of the most popular and recognizable global cuisines.
3. Health Benefits of Sushi (and Warning!)
Sushi is packed with nutrients because it relies on fish and vegetables as the main ingredients. Fish provides a lean source of low-calorie, high-quality protein. It's also low in saturated fats and cholesterol, making it a heart-healthy food choice. A healthy diet should incorporate fish at least twice a week, according to the American Heart Association. This is because fish contains high amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential to the healthy functioning of the brain. Omega-3 fatty acids are helpful for neurological disorders and may help to fight depression, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, dementia and diabetes. Fish also contains other healthy vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin D.
The seaweed wrapping of sushi rolls, Nori, is packed with nutrients. It is low in calories and contains vitamins A, B-6, and C. It also has a healthy serving of Iodine, which is essential for hormone function. Recent studies indicate that seaweed proteins may reduce blood pressure and improve heart health.
Sushi, however healthy it is, is not always a
low-calorie
option. Because the portions are small, it can be very easy to load up, taking in more calories than necessary, especially if other ingredients and condiments are added like cream cheese and mayonnaise. So, if you start to crave for more sushi after your first order, try other delicious yet lighter options such as the
vegan
varieties.
Eating Sushi for the First Time
1. Navigating the Menu
A sushi menu may seem complicated to the newbie, but there are basically four kinds of Sushi.
Nigiri Sushi – It is a small serving of cold molded rice with a slice of raw fish on top. The first type of sushi was developed in Japan and considered the most traditional of all the sushi types.
Maki is a combination of rice, vegetables and fish rolled up in tightly in thin sheets of flattened dried seaweed, called “Nori”. Maki is served sliced into six or eight pieces. Sometimes, the rolls (uramaki) are served inside out with the rice on the outside, while the nori and fish or vegetables in the middle. Maki can also be served as a kind of seaweed cone (temaki) filled with rice, fish and/or veggies.
Chirashi is a bowl of vinegared rice with a piece of fish on top.
Sashimi is a thin slice of raw fish. In some cases, the rice is served on the side, though it is not really necessary.
Sushi can be a disorienting experience if you are not used to it especially when they are served and eaten cold. Many restaurants, like Sushi Counter, will also have other cooked and hot items on the menu like soups, and noodles alongside other Asian inspired hot main dishes, like curries, so there is no need to worry if you really don’t like cold food.
2. Ordering Tips
If you are having sushi for the first time, it is a good idea to be with friends who are already sushi enthusiasts. Another option is to ask the sushi chef for guidance on what and how much to order. As a beginner, it’s best to go slow and ease your way into the wonderful
world of sushi
. Sushi is prepared with only a handful of ingredients, but the combination of flavours, textures, and tastes is amazing. Since sushi has evolved through its long history, restaurants of today are constantly innovating and adding new combinations, which are just as authentic as traditional sushi. This is part of what makes this cuisine so interesting.
Start slowly by choosing items that are more familiar or those with ingredients that you are more comfortable with until you become accustomed to the textures and flavours unique to sushi. It’s also good to prepare yourself mentally. If you encounter something you don’t like, don’t force yourself. Sushi should be a fun learning experience. Leave it and try something else. Below are some other tips that may be helpful for your first take on sushi.
Try Cooked Sushi Dishes First
Not all Sushi are raw. Eel (unagi and anago) is always served cooked, usually with a sweet and savoury sauce. California rolls have avocado, cucumber and cooked crab meat (called kamaboko or surimi). Squid (ika) or octopus (ika) are served grilled. Many restaurants also serve items like tempura (battered and fried), noodles and soups. Opt for those for a start.
Eat Sushi with Familiar Ingredients
If you are an adventurous fish lover, do try Sashimi, one of the most popular sushi dishes served without rice. As mentioned above, sashimi is a thin slice of raw fish. Choose the fish you have already tasted before like Salmon or Tuna. Chances are, if you liked the cooked or smoked version of the fish, you will likely to enjoy its fresh form.
Start with Maki Rolls
The best sushi for beginners is Maki. California rolls don't have raw ingredients. The only thing that is raw in this sushi are the vegetables. Even if you pick a variety with raw fish, the taste will not be overpowering because of the flavour of the seaweed and vegetables. You also won’t have to stare at, perhaps, an intimidating slice of raw seafood on your plate.
Stick to Vegetarian Sushi
If you’re still not ready to order something with raw fish, you can also opt for the vegetable-based sushi. Sushi Counter has many varieties including Sun Dried Tomato Basil Roll, Hummus & Cucumber Roll and Black Veggie Roll.
How to Eat it: Sushi Do’s & Don’ts
There are certain basic rules of etiquette and customs around sushi just like there are with eating any other kinds of cuisines. Here are the main things you should keep in mind.
Hands
DO: Wash your hands. Your restaurant may provide you with a hot towel to wipe your hands before you begin to eat.
Check which items should be eaten by hand and which by chopsticks to avoid embarrassment.
Sushi was traditionally eaten by hand. Maki and nigiri both should always be eaten by hand. Only sashimi and Chirashi require chopsticks.
DON'T: Do not lift Sashimi to your mouth with your fingers, and don’t eat the rice by hand.
Don’t cut up your food. Most sushi is meant to be eaten in one bite. It will taste better.
Chopsticks
DO: Some kinds of Sushi are eaten with chopsticks. If you don’t know how to use them, ask your restaurant if they provide “training” sticks, which are attached at the top, or you can make your own set, by winding a rubber band around the top of a pair of chopsticks. You can use these to eat by manipulating the sticks like pincers to pick up food items.
DON'T: Never rub your chopsticks together. This is considered rude. The habit originated with cheap establishments using poorly made chopsticks. Patrons rubbed the sticks together to get rid of splinters. If you copy this practice, you are implying that the restaurant you are patronising is cheap.
Ordering
DO: Order a few items that you are sure to eat. If you finish what you have ordered, order again.
Share items with your dining companions. Experiment and ask your chef or server for order recommendations.
DON'T: Never ask for a doggie bag. Sushi should be eaten fresh and should not kept for long periods.
Sauces & Condiments
DO: Sushi is served with three traditional sauces:
Soy sauce: a staple of Asian cuisine. Just pour a little soy sauce into a dish for dipping. Dunk the fish side of the sushi.
Wasabi: a fiercely hot sauce traditionally made from a Japanese form of the horseradish root. It is used to soften the smell of the raw fish while bringing out the flavour in each bite. It can be quite intense so try carefully the first time. If you like the taste, use it sparingly. The chef already added a portion to your sushi, but if you still want it to be extra hot, you can add a small amount on the fish.
Pickled ginger is served to cleanse the palate between dishes or bites. Consume it after you’ve eaten a piece of sushi.
DON'T: It is rude to pour too much soy sauce in the dish and to leave it unused.
Only pour a fair amount and refill as necessary.
Never drown your Sushi in the Soy Sauce. It is considered a no-no to dip your rice in the soy sauce because it will cause it to fall apart.
Don’t add any condiments when eating Nigiri because it is assumed that the chef has already added the perfect amount and any more will be insulting to his skill. You can add as much soy sauce and wasabi as you like to Sashimi.
Don’t overdo the Wasabi. Don’t trust anybody who tells you it’s Japanese pistachio ice cream and offers you a big gob of it.
Don’t eat the pickled ginger with your sushi. It’s meant to be eaten by itself.
Eating your Meal
DO: Feel free to open your mouth as wide as possible to fit in the Sushi. Chew slowly and savour the flavours. To fully enjoy your sushi experience, there is a certain recommended order to eating the fish. Go from the lighter to the darker coloured pieces, starting from white fish to red fish. This means you will be moving from a lighter flavour to a fattier one. Save the fattiest and darkest fish types for last.
DON'T: Don’t bite the sushi halfway. It should be eaten in one bite to experience the balance of flavours.
Once you have finished don’t linger. It is considered rude.
Never ask for a doggie bag. If you want to eat Sushi at home then ask for specifically prepared take-away. Sushi is best eaten fresh, and takeaway orders will be packed and wrapped in a way to preserve their freshness.

21,"If we're talking about one specific preparation: I would argue that nigiri, specifically of Ōtoro, Tako, or Uni would be a pretty good way of assessing the quality and knowledge and skill of a traditionally trained sushi chef. Unfortunately, almost none of the metrics that I care about, or are traditionally cared about, seem to matter to most American sushi eaters. Regardless, here's my reasoning as to why.

Perfect nigiri is infamous because of the various multi-step techniques that sushi chefs use to align and compact the rice grains to a desired effect. The truth is, however, that for subtle manipulation of the rice to even be possible, the rice has to be perfectly prepared, dried, and seasoned. This is the hardest part of making any sushi, and learning this from the back kitchen of a sushi restaurant is probably one of the best things I ever did from a culinary perspective.

Provided that the rice is what it should be, the size, shape, alignment of rice grains and the density and delicate nature of the nigiri rice ball will tell you a lot about the quality of the chef. Your nigiri rice ball should not be a pasty clump of sticky starchiness, it should be delicate, loose while holding its form, and fall apart during the first bite. This is achieved by understanding the correct direction and force necessary to align and compact the granules so that they stick together, yet don't bind or smush each other.

That covers the rice. The reason I mentioned the three proteins that I did is for a few reasons, some are specific to the fish. But in general, the knifework should be cut, from a clean piece of meat with no bloodline or anything like that. Specifically:
Ōtoro is the best and most expensive fish meat in the world. It should be unctuous and insanely rich, but also properly cut and seasoned so that it is pleasant to eat. Treating this fish in a way that leaves in tact its unrivaled character while enhancing it simultaneously is a skill. Secondly, the quality of the fish itself and the price being charged will tell you about the integrity of the chef. It's not that hard to get ōtoro, but the best of it is hard to get, and the quality should stack up to what you're paying for it. A good sushi chef doesn't hose their customers with crap ōtoro at $20/piece.
Tako gives you a very good sense of more blue-collar sushi making skills and knifework. Cooking octopus so that it is tender and flavorful is not easy, and the knifework to cut a piece of tako and score it properly so it doesn't resemble a pencil eraser on the palate is an acquired skill.
Uni, or sea urchin roe, is somewhat of an acquired taste, and the way that the chef treats it will give you a sense of the chef's priorities. Uni does come in varying qualities, and good uni is waaay better than bad uni. Moreover, the amount of individual pieces stacked in a single piece of gunkan maki (boat style) gives you some sense of what you're getting for your money. A nice piece of uni should have more than one piece. The best uni I've had in Japan was such a big pile of uni that it was impossible for me to eat it one bite (which you should be doing, by the way).

A few other things to look for that can give you a real good idea as to the quality of the joint overall:
The quality of their tuna in general. ""Fresh"" Ahi tuna is not something to be prized or valued (not that it's bad, but it's not worth the same price as Bluefin). In fact, don't get it. If you want bomb tuna, it should have been Bluefin flash frozen on the freaking boat, like 18 seconds after it came out of the water, and then auctioned with the head and tail cut off by a bandsaw while doing its best Han-Solo-in-Carbonite impression at Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo while a bunch of Japanese dudes chain-smoked and outbid each other in a freaking frenzy. You want your sushi fish to have been frozen, not fresh. If not just because of quality, but also because freezing kills any worms and parasites that might be in the meat. Please read this paragraph again. It's the number one most important thing to learn about sushi. Frozen = good (not always, but in regards to the prized fish, yes).
""Omakase"" is a really good way to see if your sushi chef is actually a chef or a dude who can bang out a spicy tuna roll in 23 seconds. ""Omakase"" means ""it's up to you"", and you're basically telling the chef to take you on a multi-course meal of whatever he thinks is best and interesting. It should include multiple ""different"" kinds of preparations, not just stuff on menu, and should show creativity and knowledge of the quality of his product and what's particularly in season or tasting great.
Does your sushi chef season the fish for you? Or does he expect you to do it? Not that the latter demonizes a chef, because in America people are used to doing it themselves. But because if the chef is seasoning the fish for you, and doesn't let you or want you to use soy or wasabi (which is not used properly here to begin with), it means he kicks it way old school and knows exactly how he wants the fish to taste. Don't offend him and dip the fish in a soupy mix of wasabi and soy, in fact, don't do that ever, anywhere.
Is there a constantly updated and rotating specials board telling you what's good and cheap right now? Good. Use it.
Is the fish pre-cut, or cut to order? I hope the latter.
Ask the chefs how they get their big proteins. In whole or half fish? Do they do 4 piece breakdown on the tuna themselves? Have they ever sent a fish back for not being good enough for the price? Where does the salmon come from? The answers should be, hopefully, in order: Yes, yes, like once every month, somewhere in the wild (usually Alaska).

Lots of misconceptions about sushi. Like how people misuse the term ""fresh"" (what does that even mean?). Spend some time learning about it and you'll feel better giving your (lots of) money to places that have earned and deserved your trust with quality and respect of the fish, the rice, and the customer.

22,"Simply put, it is because the depth of mastery has no end. As simple as the techniques of sushi are, one can go as deep as he wants to master the art.
This, I think, goes with any form of art, not just sushi, and it is a common belief among most Japanese: Never-ending improvement in search for perfection.
After being a sushi chef for fifteen years, I feel that I just started to understand how to make sushi rice when I mix rice with sushi vinegar. I still feel that I need lots of practice making sashimi. (please refer to my answer: Does a sashimi chef really need that much skill? Pure sashimi is just nicely cut fresh fish. The fresher the fish, the better the taste. So what exactly is the top sushi chef in the world really doing?)
I think my nigiri is still far from perfect: could use improvement to reach the perfect fish and rice balance with firmness and texture. Traditional seaweed-out rolls (Tekka/Tuna or Kappa/Cucumber) I make look very different from the ones other sushi masters make. When I compare mine with theirs, I say to myself, ""I still have long ways to go.""
In addition, most of the skills one need to learn as a sushi chef can only be obtained through experience, not through a recipe book.
For example, ""Mekiki"" an ability to tell the quality and taste of fish by looking at it, is a must for a sushi chef. I can describe what to look for in a quality fish - bright red gills, clear eyes, color, firmness - which I tell in the sushi classes I teach, yet the ability to tell only comes from experience of looking at hundreds of fish and sampling and tasting them. Only after mastering Mekiki, one will know how thick or thin to cut fish for sashimi and sushi to reach desired taste and flavor.
Furthermore, every fish is different. My physical and emotional conditions are different every day. Weather is different every day. Each day is unique, each piece of nigiri I make is different. Tuna nigiri I make today may look the same as the one I made yesterday, the truth is they are completely different nigiri. They will taste different because the amount of sushi rice and wasabi is different. How much pressure I used to form (nigiri) rice is different. Nothing is and will be the same - ever. This creates a great challenge to a sushi chef, because it is his responsibility to produce the same quality sushi, if not better, when all the conditions are different from the previous day.
So, ""Every day is a winding road"", and I find this to be fun, challenging and rewarding.
Curing Saba (Mackerel) and Kohada, how long to ""age"" fish all comes down to sushi chef's judgment based on his experience.(note: NOT all fish taste great when fresh. You can refer to my answer: How does a top sushi chef age different fish?). It's possible to write down the recipe and technique, yet in the end, when a chef makes a decision, it's his intuition - from lots of experience and actual training - which determines the quality of his skill and the taste of the dish he creates.
At the age of eighty, the Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa received an honorary Lifetime Achievement Award at Oscars for his fifty seven year old film career. During his speech, Kurosawa said, ""I don't think I understand the cinema yet,"" which made everyone laugh because everyone thought he was joking. He sincerely meant it and I'm now starting to understand what he was talking about.
Being surprised by the people's unexpected reaction to his comment, Kurosawa quickly rephrased it by saying, ""I really don't feel I have yet grasped the essence of cinema. Cinema is a marvelous thing, and to grasp the true essence is very difficult.""
I am no Kurosawa. Nonetheless, I know Sushi is a marvelous thing and to grasp the true essence of sushi, is very long and difficult.
Yes, I still have long long ways to go indeed.

Just like you can pick up a brush, and paint whatever you like on a canvas and call yourself an artist, or go to school and learn, become an apprentice under a famous artist, or just paint on your own, you can take one-day sushi making class and call yourself a sushi chef, or become an apprentice under Jiro Ono for several years, and making sushi rice, not being called ""Sushi Chef.""
I watched an interview of Yosuke Imada, the second owner/head sushi chef at Kyubei in Ginza. He was attending Tokyo Sushi Academy and watching students making sushi. When asked how they were doing, he said, ""Well, they can make nigiri and their nigiri looks like the work done by someone with three months experience. A nigiri made by a chef with ten years of experience will look and taste like the work done by a chef with ten years of experience.""
In a nutshell, I can tell you what a sushi chef needs to learn:
How to work clean - keep work environment and personal hygiene clean
To be respectful - to other people and ingredients especially fish
To keep the tools in the best condition - sharpening knife, keep them clean and organized
To keep everything organized - every tool and ingredients have their own place in the kitchen
Rice - How to wash, rinse and cook rice. How to mix sushi vinegar with rice to make sushi rice. To mix sushi vinegar. Learn the recipes of sushi vinegar. Learn the taste of sushi vinegar and sushi rice. The temperature of sushi rice. Type of rice and make custom blend of rice, if necessary

24,"Assuming that best sushi means places like Sukiyabashi Jiro, Sawada, Mizutani, and Kyubei, here are some things I've noticed that separate the good from the great:

No attitude or pretense. All of the above places are fun to eat at, with the sushi chef actively engaging with the clientele ensuring they are having a good time.

Rice. Temperature, acidity (amount of vinegar), texture, doneness, evenness of mold, consistency of pieces.

Timing. Sushi has a rhythm ... an even pace between courses. A well-timed sushi meal should last no more than an hour.

No tables. Once a piece of sushi is prepared, it must be eaten immediately (within 15 seconds) before the temperature of the rice cools, the temperature of the fish rises, and the rice begins to get soggy. This type of service can only be achieved at the bar where the chef hands off each piece of sushi.

Pre-applied soy sauce. It's the chef's responsibility to sauce each piece of fish moments before handing it to you.

Variety. Lots of different animals from the sea. Clams, urchin, shrimp, white fish, red fish, eggs, etc ...

Various cuts of the same fish. This is particularly important with tuna, where lean, medium fatty, and very fatty cuts have very different flavors and textures. Also with different types of shrimp (mantis shrimp, sweet shrimp, botan shrimp)

In the US, I think there's a correlation between a sushi restaurant's dessert menu and authenticity. The above places serve a simple slice of fruit or melon for dessert. If the dessert choices are red bean or green tea ice cream, the menu has been tempered to suit a non-Japanese palate.

25,"Originally Answered: What is the best sushi place in the world?
My best sushi place in the world is a place called Matsumi in a small village in Northern Nagano. I have no idea how the sushi compares to that shop in Ginza station that had a documentary made about it (Jiro Dreams of Sushi) and has Michelin stars. But there is a reason Matsumi is the best sushi place in the world.
Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name.
The sushi is great but the owners go to great length to take care of my and my customers and my daughter. They are always glad we came. When I have customers they will let the children practice making sushi rice by using “nuka” which is rice bran mixed with water, the same way he learned how to practice making a sushi.
They let us make our own rolled sushi, the dress the kids up in sushi chef gear for photo ops. When I met them the other day at one of their competitor’s shop (a new ramen shop in the village) they came to sit with us and eat dinner.
The famous Jiro shop, I assume has mostly regulars, but you need to make a reservation months or years in advance, and from the documentary they seemed very cold. It looked like a cold experience.
Number two best sushi in the world for me is from a fast food sushi chain called Kappa-zushi. The sushi itself is crap, but it has the conveyor belt and if you order soemthing special on the touch screen around the bar, they send it out on a little shinkansen bullet train with plates on the back that stops at your spot at the bar.
Why is this the best in the world? Because my daughter loves to go there. (it is also really cheap) In fact, I put that in my trips for foreign visitors as well, and everyone loves it. This is also a place that if you go on a Friday or Saturday night it is packed with families from the area, and always sure to meet other families you know.
Number three is a shop called Miki in Ann Arbor Michigan, where I used to work on the wait staff while in University. That was great because I had all the free sushi I wanted - both because the chefs would give me their mishaps, and also because the staff all ate the leftover sushi from the tables (it is non-touched sushi) But mainly because I loved going to work and the closeness of the staff. Of course, this was sushi in America, so probably not so good by Japanese standards because it can never be as fresh, but…
I think you get my point. The best sushi place in the world is where you feel like you belong and you enjoy being there.

26,"Absolutely, they know how.
While you may think of sushi as this:
it also includes this:
The first is nigiri sushi, the second is a futomaki (fat roll) which is a thick version of norimaki (rolled sushi like cucumber or tuna rolls).
I am married to a Japanese woman and lived in Japan for three years. It is common to see rolled sushi in picnics or casual dinner parties. I have never met a Japanese person (doesnt have to be a female or a housewife) who doesn't know how to make one.
From what my wife tells me, culinary arts are taught in Japanese schools. This of course is centered on Japanese cuisine (although other types like Italian which is popular in Japan) is also taught.
Besides that would be your mother teaching a daughter how to prepare food and the ubiqutous television programs and magazines dealing with food.
You'd have to live in a box in Japan not to know how to do certain things with food.
Another example:
As the title says: Temaki sushi (hand rolls). Japanese people love not just eating food, they like the experience of cooking or creating. Communal cooking like nabe (hot pots) or yakiniku (korean style grill cooking) is very popular.
Temaki sushi parties are also popular. Guest get to assemble their food (like a North American taco party) and off they go. Everybody does this. Male and female (housewife or not).
Sometimes my wife and I buy a chunk of fish and make nigiri.
It may be not as good as what may come from a master chef, or in the case of norimaki, may not look as good as this:
But it definitely is sushi.
And probably 99.9% of Japanese housewives know how to make it.

27,"If your wallet permits you, would you buy sushi every day? Isn't sushi healthier than pizza and fried chicken wings?
The secret to keeping something very special, in my opinion, is not to indulge in it all the time. These days, people eat what used to be special occasion food whenever they feel like it, and pretty soon it’s not that special any more.
When I was growing up, my grandma would come to visit once a month or so, and bring a big package of sliced beef so we could have sukiyaki. It was a special once a month treat and my sisters and I looked forward to it. Having to miss meals and being hungry must be terrible. On the other hand, having enough resources that enables you to eat whatever you like at any time you want, to me is in a way a tragedy.
I would not eat sushi every day even if I lived in Japan and had access to the best sushi restaurant. Yes, it’s not as bad as pizza and fried chicken wings for your health. But there are so many other wonderful food in this world, why would I limit myself to just one? It seems like a sure way to get bored of it quickly.
Anisakis infections from eating raw fish is on the rise in Japan. It’s another good reason to not indulge in eating raw fish too often, especially if you live in Japan.

29,"5 reasons to love sushi
We already love sushi passionately, but did you know that, besides being incredibly tasty, sushi is also very healthy? These are some of the reasons why you should add sushi to your weekly diet.
1․ Sushi helps to control your weight
There is nothing better than a delicious dinner with friends, is it? But as soon as the summer holidays are approaching, it becomes more and more difficult to control the amount of food eaten by us. Add sushi to your diet! These fantastic pieces of real art are not only tasty but can also be super healthy and have low-calorie content. Order a salad to the dish, enjoy sushi and get the right portion of healthy proteins.
2․ Wasabi prevents food poisoning
Sushi and wasabi go hand in hand. But did you know that fiery spicy green paste has its own health benefits? Not only does it soften the smell of raw fish and improve its flavour, but it also kills bacteria that can cause food poisoning.
3․ Sushi improves memory
Tuna and salmon contain a large amount of omega-3 fatty acids, which improves memory and has a beneficial effect on mental abilities. Say no to memory problems!
4․ Ginger is able to rid you of wrinkles
Well, really, ginger is too useful for us! Besides the fact that ginger gives sushi an incredible zest, it is also a treasure of antioxidants which help to prevent wrinkles on your skin. How do you like this replacement for expensive cosmetics?
5․ Sushi gives you vital energy
Nori (seaweed used for sushi wrap) is filled with B12 vitamins. Therefore, sushi can be considered the best source of B12 for vegetarians. B12 is a very important nutrient that converts the food we consume into glucose used for energy. No more energy drinks: just eat sushi!

30,"The possible parasites from sushi are zero where the fish has been commercially frozen. Where the fish has NOT been frozen, such as in much of Japan, two types of parasite are possible. Marine (salt-water) fish can be infested with small roundworms, typically Anisakis or Phocanema. These are incapable of completing their life cycle in the human (they need a marine mammal such as seal or walrus and then herring, cod, haddock, etc.). But in the survival time, they can puncture the epithelial lining of the alimentary canal, and give rise to pain and sometimes peritonitis. (“False” appendicitis is one of the common manifestations of Anisakiasis in Japan).
Fresh water species can contain the cyst of the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum, but realistically, with sashimi, this is limited to salmon (which of course as an “anadromous” species, spends a portion of its life in fresh AND salt water). This cyst, if viable, can develop into a tapeworm in the human that can extent the full length of the intestine (10 metres).
Both are killed by freezing.
The question asks how likely? In North America and most of Europe, frozen fish are used, with zero risk. Eat in Japan, or prepare do-it-yourself ceviche, and the risks increase to some extent. But Anisakiasis is self-limited, and Diphyllobothriasis is not a threat to a well-fed human.

31,"Thanks for the A2A, but my answer is probably not what you were looking for (ideas for American-style rolls). Those roll recipes are all over the net, very easy to find.
I discovered sushi in a close to authentic Japanese version (real Edomae-tradition trained chef, limited range of ingredients as it was in North America) sitting at the counter and being guided by the chef (who had moved to the East coast because coming to Cali from Tokyo he found he didn’t like the style so much and back then the trend was set and on a roll and the area was no longer very open to a more authentic take.) and I so never became an amateur of American-style sushi - to me they’re mostly the junk food version of sushi, unless they’re really high end. I like avocado, but not with sushi. At that first sushi bar I used to go in the 80s, rolls were still a mere sideshow (to nigirizushi/gunkan), showing up at temaki to showcase something (“wow, those uni are fabulous” - “Have you tasted uni paired with ikura? They served that as donburi in the north - here, try the pairing with this roll”), or else as hosomaki (thin roll, limited to one or few ingredients) toward the end of the meal.
So for me the fillings are those of fairly traditional hosomaki: cucumbers, preferably real Japanese kyuri that are super crunchy, maguro or chutoro with negi, buri with negi, various pickles (but I’m not too fond of them in sushi if they’re industrially made), ume, wasabi & shiso, natto etc. etc. A non-traditional variant I like is teriyaki salmon skin and raw salmon.
I don’t think mixing a ton of strongly flavoured ingredients improves sushi. It doesn’t taste bad (some of those American rolls are quite tasty), but it’s like a lot of American foods: too many flavours, masking the natural tastes too much.
Filling for inarizushi I make at home is usualy sushi rice mixed with simmered vegetables and mushrooms, though I’ve used chopped salmon or tuna, canned tuna or salmon, crab meat, cooked little shrimps, meat or fish soboro etc.
I don’t make bento-style futomaki very often, but I like the traditional ones, and more modern versions, but usually more Japanese-style.
Someone else mentioned this already I think, but a “quick evening meal” I like in summer is a tuna salad, Japanese mayo, maybe pickles, wasabi, with crunchy cucumber and mizuna or another green- in a medium-sized makizushi.

32,"Sushi has many varieties. In general, most of sushi are safe. Only raw fish such as salmon, bonito, squid and mackerel should be treated carefully because they might have parasites. But the parasites die at minus 20 degrees C (minus 68 degrees F) for more than 24 hours. This is Japan and EU standard. U.S. standard requires to freeze these fish at minus 35 degrees C (minus 95 degrees F) for 15 hours or minus 20 degrees C (minus 68 degrees F) for 24 hours.
You can buy ""Sushi (or Sashimi) grade"" salmon, which is previously frozen and safe. Walmart salmon has a label: Not for raw consumption"" or something like that.

33,"I personally eat three “grades” of sushi around where I live (Boston area): “good” sushi, from fairly nice and traditional Japanese restaurants, “cheap” sushi, from the more regular sushi places that may also serve Chinese food, and supermarket sushi. There’s at least one “grade” higher, with restaurants that have months-long waiting lists and cost several hundreds of dollars, but I don’t eat that kind of sushi.
I grew up on the “cheap” stuff. I’ve been eating cucumber rolls since I was a kid, and I loved it. It wasn’t marketing; I just liked the sushi rice wrapped in nori, and the stuff inside was irrelevant to me. As I grew up, I tried more stuff. Spicy tuna rolls, other vegetable rolls, stuff like that. I didn’t really see the point of trying more expensive rolls because, well, I didn’t have a lot of money and it all tasted the same anyway, right? Eventually I started getting more adventurous, and I discovered special rolls. There was a Chinese-Japanese mall-type restaurant with sushi near school, where the inexpensive sushi was made ahead of time and put in boxes you could grab quickly, and I tried the different items: eel, salmon skin, spicy tuna, etc. Pretty tasty. Eventually I started working and actually had money to spend on food; I had been steadily exploring the special rolls, and I read some article talking about how they were actually American-style like sushi sandwiches, and real Japanese sushi was all about the rice. So I went to my local “good” sushi place and ordered many different types of nigiri instead of American rolls with spicy mayo (which I like a lot), and wow, it was a different experience. They have daily specials, from whatever fish they were able to get fresh that day (or that week, I don’t know when they do purchasing), as well as special preparations like marinated fish, torched salmon belly, etc. Some restaurants even have special nigiri; I don’t know how traditional that is, but I like it a lot. I tend to eat those now when I get sushi. It’s more expensive, yes, but it’s so delicious! There’s never been any real marketing to get me to eat it. I’ve just tried it and judged it myself.
There’s one kind of sushi, though, that is based on hype: supermarket sushi. Oh, supermarket sushi. Sushi needs to be made fresh. Sometimes, supermarket sushi is indeed fresh. I eat it sometimes. But leave it sitting in the fridge area a few hours, and it becomes awful. People still eat it, too. But man. The fish is fine; it’s not going to go bad. The problem is the rice. Sushi shouldn’t be cold; it should be room temperature. When rice gets cold, it dries out, and the quality goes from edible to total crap. Oh, and it’s always way overpriced, too! I’ve had good supermarket sushi (when the chef is there and does it in front of you), but once it’s been sitting out for a few hours, forget about it. And it’s never good fish either. Supermarket sushi is not very good.
Evaluation: supermarket sushi is not very good in general, but if you can get it fresh it’s not bad. “Cheap” sushi is delicious but not very traditional. “Good” sushi is subtle and also delicious but only if you have a discerning palate; otherwise, “cheap” sushi will make you happier. And really expensive sushi can wait for someone with more money!

34,"It depends a bit on where you live and how good the restaurant you plan to eat at is, also how adventurous you are. Do you eat a lot of cooked fish and seafood? Are you looking for something authentic (ie: Japanese) or something more fusion?
Sushi is very easy to get to love for fish lovers. It’s harder to acquire a taste for it if you don’t like seafood much in the first place. Raw fish is actually milder tasting than cooked fish, and when it’s good fish, it has very pleasing, easy to like textures.
I’d start with this advice: whatever you do, don’t try with grocery store/refrigerated take-out sushi - it just isn’t good. Don’t try sushi the first time at a lower quality restaurant either. Go for a well-reputed restaurant, but not too high-end either as your taste buds aren’t trained enough and for a beginner it’s pretty much a waste of money. A 150$ omakase dinner (chef’s choice, akin to a tasting menu) isn’t a great option for the first few times.
My other advice would be this: if you can afford a pretty decent sushi bar, make a reservation to sit at the bar and tell the chef you’re a beginner and need his guidance. He’s the best person there is to give you a great first experience and take into account what you’re comfortable with. He also knows his menu and products. Don’t be shy: it’s part of what being a sushi chef is all about - he’ll be (or she’ll be) happy to help. Normally, eating sushi at a sushi bar is much more about variety - not about eating 10 pieces of your favorite topping, but about tasting the 10 best pieces of the moment (sushi is very seasonal, traditionally). Ordering whole rolls or a plate of several salmon nigiri, is done a lot but it’s not Japanese sushi anymore.
If you’re opting for a very Americanized (or outside the US, Westernized.. though it’s still very California-influenced) sushi place, the raw toppings that usually fare the best with beginners are salmon and tuna. Then there’s cooked shrimp, BBQ eel and a sweet omelet called “tamagoyaki”. If everything goes well with the salmon and tuna, you can then try tastier (more “fishy”) fish such as hamachi/buri (yellowtail) or saba/sawara (two types of mackerels, both usually marinated). Scallops (hotate) are also very easy to love, soft, mild and sweet.
But like I said, it depends on where you’re from. Marinated Mackerel (shime saba) or salmon nigiri are very good try-out choices if you’re Scandinavian. Not so much if you’re an American whose experience of fish is only breaded white fish.
Of the fish eggs, tobiko is definitely the easiest to love for a beginner. If you love a lot the taste of the sea, then salmon eggs, ikura, are a real delight, and so are sea urchins, uni. Both are probably too tasty for most beginners. Other toppings that are likely to put off beginners could include ika (raw cuttlefish) that people outside Asia tend to find too chewy. It’s bit the same for octopus (tako). Westerners who eat octopus at all are used to very tender meat, whereas for sushi it’s kept much firmer. Rarer items like ankimo (monkfish liver, like fishy foie gras), raw octopus, kazunoko, shirako, quite a few of the meatier shellfish like akagai aren’t so likely to show up (nor are a slew of other toppings only found outside Japan in higher end restaurants such as Japanese fish and seafood like kohada, amadai, kinmedai, houbou, suzuki, amaebi, hirame, ise ebi, many kind of roes, etc.).
For rolls I’d second the advice already given: try hoso-maki (small rolls, made with half a sheet of nori) and start with kappa and teka maki (cucumber roll, tuna roll). Kappa maki in particular needs to be eaten right after it’s made, while the seaweed is crispy. That way, it’s a delight. It’s a pointless item if the nori got soggy. It baffles me when I see people at other tables order several cucumber rolls as part of a big platter. It’s an item definitely best eaten at the bar, straight from the chef’s hands.
The medium to big rolls full of ingredients and flavours aren’t typically part of an authentic sushi experience. They’re good in a fast-food (deluxe or not) sort of way, if for the most part they’re pretty unhealthy compared to traditional sushi… a lot of sweet sauces, very caloric Japanese mayonnaise, a lot of fried food, overuse of cheap but very oily avocado. They’re much beloved outside Japan, but it’s not traditional sushi and IMO not the best way to try sushi for a first time, but I’m very fond of authentic sushi and not so much of the American-style sushi, so I’m definitely biased. The “fat rolls” are usually for lunch boxes (with a series of cooked ingredients) and celebrations in Japan, or only found in restaurants that serve “western style” sushi…
If authenticity isn’t something you care about, those American-style rolls are definitely the most beginner-friendly items on any sushi menu. Pick the ones with the ingredients you find most appealing.

35,"Traditional Edo•Mae/Tokyo Style sushi chefs consider Te•Ate/Prep Work an important part of their skill. Te•Ate consisting of Shime/Salt and Vinegar Curing, Aburi/Lightly Sear and Smoke, or Zuke/Soy Marinate are the techniques to enhance the flavor of fish, carrying the tradition from the time when Nigiri was invented one hundred fifty years ago. Edo Style sushi chefs thrive on their Te•Ate techniques to make the fish taste better than when they were raw.
 
Therefore, any sushi showcasing the sushi chef's Te•Ate would be a good one to test his skill. One of them is Kohada/Gizzard Shad.
 
To make the perfect Kohada is a challenge. The reason is in its recipe. It goes something like this:
 
After cutting, fileting and cleaning Kohada, sprinkle some salt and let it sit for fifteen to forty minutes, then marinate it in rice vinegar for ten to thirty minutes.
 
If you read it carefully, you will notice that the recipe is very vague. There is nothing to tell you if you should marinate in salt for fifteen or thirty minutes.
 
The only way to understand this recipe and master it is through experience. No one can teach you. It can only be learned by each person. One must first watch other sushi chefs filet hundreds and hundreds of Kohada, salting, vinegaring, watching how their colors turn and how the taste changes after day or two.  After watching the process, then, one must practice by doing the same, making lots of lots of mistakes until one develops one's taste and eye to determine how long to marinate the fish in salt and vinegar, and how long to let it sit before Kohada is ready to be served.
 
I suppose it's something similar to wine making, where one's experience and developed senses are required and even then, you'll never know how it will turn out in the end.
 
Saba is another one that requires curing in salt and vinegar and just like Kohada. The only difference is that it's easier to filet and cure because Saba is bigger than Kohada.

The other Edo•Mae Sushi that require Te•Ate are:
Anago/Sea Eel
Ni•Hama•Guri/Boiled Clam
Tako/Octopus (boiled)
Ebi/Shrimp (boiled)

Any sushi that requires no Te•Ate is NOT such a good indicator of a sushi chef's skill because it reveals limited techniques. Uni, or Toro both require very little or no Te•Ate, therefore, are not a good choice of sushi to test chef's ability. If given the same ingredients, I would say it would be very difficult to tell the difference between Uni made by the master chef and the one made one a beginner because for Uni, all one has to do is put it on top of sushi rice.
 
In Japan, it has been said that if you want to know how good a sushi establishment is, order Tamago/Egg Custard.
 
Though not fish, Tamago is a good sushi to test a chef’s skill because it involves heat control. Training of Tamago usually comes after a sushi chef masters the fish preparation, so good Tamago means the chef has spent a reasonable amount of years in training.
 
There is one sushi that sushi chefs use to test other sushi chef's skill.
 
It's called Su•Maki or Rice Roll.
 
It’s seaweed out Hoso•Maki/Thin Roll with just sushi rice inside.
 
Eating and looking at Su•Maki, can reveal several things.
 
1. It tells you a lot about Sushi Rice
Because Su•Maki has no fish or vegetables inside, you can only taste the flavor of sushi rice and seaweed. The combination of sushi rice and seaweed is the base for any traditional Japanese sushi rolls, so it will reveal the level of chef's skill in making sushi rice and forming the roll.
 
It will also tell you chef’s choice in reaching the recipe such as:
Type of rice vinegar - regular vs. red rice vinegar
Type of rice – region, kind (Sa•sa•nishiki, Koshi•hikari, California, Oregon for US, etc.)
Single rice, or blended (many high-profile sushi establishments blend several types if rice)
Type or Nori/Seaweed

It's important to understand that one is never better than the other - just because one sushi chef uses red rice vinegar over regular rice vinegar, it does not automatically mean his sushi is better. It's the reasoning behind it that matters.
 
2. What does the inside of a Su•Maki tell you?
Inside of Hoso•Maki should have rice evenly placed so that they are bound together, at the same time, there should be some space in between rice, so that if you were to pour some soy sauce from the top, it will run through to the sushi rice to the bottom of the roll.
 
This is very very very difficult to achieve because you need to keep each grain of rice intact when you make sushi rice as well as when you apply it on Nori/Seaweed and roll it.
 
According to Chef Mizutani (a former apprentice of Jiro Ono) of Sushi Mizutani in Tokyo, the only person who can make this perfect Hoso•Maki is Jiro Ono.
 
Because Su•Maki is only made when a (master or trained) sushi chef wants to see other chef's skill, it's not on a menu. In fact, if you are not sushi chef, you will never be able to order it. (or more like you should never order it at all.)
 
Then, what should you order instead?
 
I would order Kappa• Maki/Cucumber roll, or Tekka•Maki/Tuna Roll (both are Thin, Seaweed Out Rolls.)
 
It should be enough to tell you the sushi chef’s skill.

If not, how about a California Roll, or Spicy Tuna?

As a matter of fact, I do order Spicy Tuna a lot to see the quality of sushi at a sushi restaurant in US I visit for the first time.
 
If after one piece and you are unsure what you are looking for, keep eating until you can tell. Just as sushi chefs need lots of experience slicing fish, you also need a lot of experience tasting and sampling great sushi to develop your taste buds and senses.

36,"The first thing I do is to refer the price on the menu.

Let's say Tuna Nigiri is $5/2pcs and the omakase included one piece of tuna. Then the price for one piece of tuna is $2.5.

If Tuna sashimi is $10/4pcs and the omakase had two pieces, the price is $5.

The rest is up to the chef.

What do I mean by that?

Omakase can be either completely custom menu or preset menu.

Some of the Sushi restaurants in the US set the price first - say $100/pp.  I know that Kusakabe in San Francisco currently offers Omakase menu for $95/pp. Then the chef(s) orders the fish and decides what to include in the omakase menu based on the price of the fish. The standard cost of ingredeitns for restaurants in the US is about 25%-30% of the menu price. So, say the slice of tuna costs $3 for a nigiri, and then the menu price of tuna nigiri is $9.

When I create a special dish for omakase, I may use parts of the fish that are normally not used for other dish and I may create something that is not on the menu. The pricing of that special dish is up to me to decide. The general rule of thumb is to compare to other dishes on the menu, calculating how many and how much ingredients I've used to make the dish.

From what I observed watching other sushi chefs, omakase gets a slightly better deal/break, as most sushi chefs will give you more fish/dish that you would normally pay for. I do the same for my omakase as well.  You will also get an extra portion and special part of the fish you wouldn't normally get. One of them is engawa because there are only one or two servings from the whole fish and I would like to save it for a special customer.

37,"Is the bluefin tuna in danger of becoming extinct?
Although debated by many fishermen, the answer to the question is a resounding “Yes”. There seems to be a consensus in the scientific community that if populations continue to decline at current rates, there is decent probability that we will see the collapse and extinction of two bluefin stocks in our lifetime. Bluefin populations are declining because of overfishing, which is defined by Merriam-Webster as fishing to the detriment of (a fishing ground) or to the depletion of (a kind of organism). Or more simply, it is the taking of wildlife from the ocean at rate faster than it can be replaced. Globally, overfishing of bluefin tuna can be attributed to commercial fishing, which is the activity of catching fish and other marine wildlife for profit. The relatively recent trend of overfishing Bluefin tuna can be attributed to the rise in global demand for sushi grade fish, of which the bluefin is one of the most prized for its texture and high fat content. In fact, In January of 2013 a single 489 pound Bluefin sold $1.8 million at auction in Tokyo, Japan. With this insatiable demand the outlook for bluefin’s future looks bleak, however there is still hope. Solutions for this problem do exist and a well managed, sustainable fishery is indeed a possibility. However, it will require large sweeping changes in current policy and fishing practices.

Bluefin: The Data
The bluefin tuna, part of the genus Thunnus, is comprised of four different species or stocks; the Southern Bluefin, Pacific Bluefin, Atlantic Bluefin and Northen Bluefin. Of the four species, two are in indeed in danger of becoming extinct.  First, the Southern Bluefin, which is mostly found in the worlds oceans between the latitudes of 30°S and 50°S is listed as critically endangered by the ICUN. It is estimated the the Southern Bluefin has been fished to just 8% of its pre-commercial fishing population. Second, the Atlantic Bluefin which is found in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea is is listed endangered by by the ICUN. Atlantic Bluefin are at 36% of their pre-commercial fishing numbers. Despite the alarming data and ICUN listings, harvest of these fish has not ceased.

Why are stocks declining so fast?
Stocks are declining rapidly because of overfishing, specifically growth overfishing and recruitment overfishing. The first type of overfishing we will explore is recruitment overfishing. Recruitment overfishing occurs when the adult bluefin population is harvested to the point where it no longer has the ability to replenish itself.  In other words, there are not enough adults to produce new offspring. There are solutions to mitigate this this type of overfishing, such as putting a maximum allowable size for harvest. For example, no fish can be taken larger than specified size. The second type of overfishing is growth overfishing. This is essentially the opposite of growth overfishing, and occurs when bluefin are harvested before they reach peak sexual maturity, or even sexual maturity at all. Growth overfishing is especially detrimental to bluefin tuna, who take 3 to 12 years to reach sexual maturity depending on where they live.  Growth overfishing is rapidly becoming more common as fishermen are exhausting populations of large fish forcing them to harvest smaller sexually immature tuna. The solution to this is the opposite of recruitment; placing a minimum size requirement on fish to be harvested to allow fish to reproduce before being harvested. A rather elegant solution has been proposed that satisfies both of these issues is a slot limit. Slot limits require harvested fish to be above a certain size, and below another. Implementation of a slot limits could effectively put an end to these two types of overfishing.

Who is responsible for overfishing?
The decline in bluefin populations can solely be attributed to commercial fishing. Commercialization of fishing provides an incentive for fishermen to increase their catch and short term economic gains, at the unfortunate expense of the environment and long term sustainability. Through my research I found an economic explanation as to why overfishing is happening. Currently fish stocks are regarded as a common property resource, or something that individuals cannot be excluded from. Common pool resources face problems of of abuse, because they are finite. Subsequently, when commercial fishermen harvest fish they incur a negative externality that is not priced into commercial fishing costs leading to an inefficient market resulting in a price that is lower than it should be. This is what is referred to by economists as the tragedy of the commons. As bad as this sounds, there is a solution to this that has just been implemented which I will discuss later.

 

How are bluefin caught?
Techniques used to harvest bluefin include, seine nets, longlines, rod and reel and harpooning. The ways commercial fishing is done has changed drastically in the last sixty years due to advances in technology allowing for larger ships and increased efficiency. The biggest technological changes taking place after WWII, when technologies developed during the war such as sonar, radar and refrigeration improvements were implemented for commercial fishing. More recently, satellite technology has allowed fishermen to easily find large productive areas for fishing with sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and current charts a mouse click away. 
The most common technique utilized for bluefin fishing is purse seining. A purse seine vessel will locate a large school of tuna and then deploy a net around them, called the seine. When the seine is wrapped around the school of tuna the bottom is closed, or pursed. This technique of fishing is especially efficient at catching fish species that school close to the surface such bluefin. Some of the boats used for this technique can be enormous. One such vessel is the Albatun Tres, which is an astounding 377 feet long, can hold 3000 tons of fish in one trip. Simply put, the odds are enormously in the favor of the modern fishermen, more so than at any point in history before.

What has been done to limit overfishing?
Mitigation efforts for bluefin overfishing have so far been met with mixed results. One common solution to overfishing are quotas. Quotas set limits on the amount of bluefin that can be harvested for a period of time, such as a season. Quotas can be an effective tool for managing the amount of fish that are harvested. However, they are only as effective if the amounts set are reasonable. If a quota is set too high, overfishing can still result. Unfortunately, this has been all too common with bluefin, where quotas are consistently placed above scientist recommendation. A recent advancement in terms of quotas are individual transferable quotas or ITQs. ITQs create a commodity market for the right to fish and can be bought, sold, or leased or fished allowing for the most efficient fishing possible. Another possible solution is the removal of the large government fishing subsidies. Subsequently, this will force the industry to become more efficient and will force inefficient operations out of the market and increase prices, reducing demand.
Unfortunately, even ITQs have their limits. This due to the fact that bluefin are extremely migratory, and are also a common pool resource. Since they are a common pool resource, several countries agreeing to limit or stop bluefin take could in essence be pointless if another country continues fishing for them. Many countries whose economies are dependent on fishing are very hesitant to stop harvest. This is extremely similar to what is happening with the Southern Bluefin right now. In situations like this, solutions can be only reached when agreements are made between countries. While this is indeed happening and large strides have been made in recent years, it is a long and slow process. In the meantime however tuna populations continue to deteriorate.

Can I do anything to help?
To me it is clear that if we don’t take action soon, we will possibly experience the collapse of and extinction of two bluefin fisheries in our lifetime. It is possible through the intelligent regulation to stop the exploitation and reduce harvest to responsible levels. This can only be done with intergovernmental cooperation and enforcement of responsible fishing policy. Unfortunately, there is a distinct possibility that this will not happen before it is too late. This is why I believe above all else, the most effective strategy is consumer education. Educating consumers on what they are buying, and the consequences to the environment is a powerful tool to help end overfishing.Therefore it is imperative that consumers take action where it will affect the commercial industry the most, and that is to simply not purchase bluefin tuna. If we as a society become educated and stop consuming bluefin at high levels, the demand as a whole will fall and subsequently the profitability will fall. In conclusion, it is possible to stop the extinction of bluefin tuna if drastic measures are taken soon.

40,"In Japan, there are restaurants specializing in Basashi, raw horse sashimi. Some of those restaurants offer Basashi Nigiri.
 
Basashi is a very specialized dish and unique local cuisine. As such it is said that there are only a few prefectures in Japan (Kumatomo and Nagano) where people eat Basashi as part of their regular diet.
 
Because of this fact, it is rare, not just for sushi chefs, but any other chefs in Japan to learn how to serve horsemeat. For most sushi chefs including myself, the main ingredients being fish and that is what sushi chefs focus on. In Japan, there is variety of fish unique to each region and seasons, so it can take more than a lifetime to master how to handle and serve those fish as sushi ingredients.
 
Even for most Japanese, eating basashi is a rare occurrence. I've eaten basashi probably less than five times in my life. (my wife only once.)
 
Personally, to include Basashi nigiri between fish nigiri would be too much - meaning that the strong flavor of basashi would distract the subtle and mild flavor of some of the fish. Also, I would have to set up a different cutting board to handle raw horsemeat so that smell of fish would never transfer to basashi or vice versa. As there are plenty of fish I can use for sushi and my focus as a sushi chef is mainly fish, including Basashi is something I don't think of it, not because I am against it, but simply because I am interested in finding a great fish and serving it.
 
In addition, getting nice Basashi would be a very challenge, as I'd assume there are a few distributors in Japan. Also in US, I’d presume it to be almost impossible to serve basashi due to a moral issue associated with eating horsemeat.
 
I'd served Gyu tataki nigiri along with fish nigiri. Because I know more about handling beef than horsemeat, I'd feel fine serving it. To me, Gyu Tataki nigiri is similar to Toro nigiri or Seared Toro nigiri.
 
That being said, I am never against any sushi chefs or sushi restaurants to serve Basashi nigiri if they choose to do so, and I think it would add interesting variety to their menu.

42,"The standard guidelines from sources like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the CDC, and the FDA advise women to avoid sushi (when it is raw fish) while pregnant. However, the actual science and data behind this guidelines isn’t all that straightforward.
Pregnant women should avoid sushi for two reasons:
Exposure to mercury, which is bad for the development of the fetus. This risk is higher in certain fish and is present regardless of whether the fish is raw or cooked. The main correlation with sushi is that a lot of fish popular for sushi is also high in mercury, like tuna.
Exposure to harmful diseases: note that there is a big difference between diseases that make the pregnant women sick, but don’t directly harm the fetus, and diseases that directly harm the fetus. The two diseases which are really dangerous for the fetus are listeria and toxoplasmosis. Listeria is found in all kinds of foods, but pregnant women are cautioned to avoid raw cheeses, deli meat, and some other foods (sometimes sushi) to avoid listeria. Toxoplasmosis is found in animal feces, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid cat litter and gardening. On the other hand, most diseases you might get from eating sushi or things like raw eggs are things like food poisoning and salmonella; while these will make the pregnant woman very sick, which is bad, they do not directly attack the fetus.
My understanding is that pregnant women in Japan often eat raw sushi, knowing that the fish there is likely to be very fresh and therefore not likely to result in disease.
Emily Oster is an economist who wrote a book with her research about what is / is not safe during pregnancy. She reviewed all the primary research herself and noted that a lot of the guidelines that seem really wide-sweeping and scary (i.e., don’t eat any sushi) are based on studies that show pretty low actual risk.

43,"In my opinion, the answer is no.

Some things, such as plumbing, electrical work, and sushi making are best left to professionals.

There are several reasons for this, including my own personal tastes.  I've eaten a lot of sushi during my lifetime and can tell the difference between good sushi and bad sushi.  Getting the right balance of properly cooked rice and seasonings can be tricky (but certainly not impossible) for the amateur sushi maker.  User has published an excellent primer, which can be found here. http://www.justhungry.com/2003/1...

Most dishes, if made at home, are much more economical than the equivalent meal you'll find at a restaurants.  In the case of sushi, this may not necessarily be the case.  The problem with home-made sushi is the nature of sushi itself.  Sushi is meant to be eaten on the day it was made (most optimally, within minutes).  If you put rice into the refrigerator today, it will be nearly inedible by tomorrow.  You cannot throw simply it into the microwave to bring it back to life -- sushi is not meant to be eaten warm/hot.  If you violate this law, the sushi police will arrest you.


Secondly, you'll lose the economies of scale by attempting this at home.  You cannot purchase the exact amount you need and will inevitably have some wastage (if you're unable to figure out how to use the leftovers).  Look at each of the ingredients below and tell me if you disagree.  That's a nice way of saying, you're about to eat the most expensive sushi you've ever had.


This is what maguro (tuna) looks like at the supermarket.  That's the fish you'll need for the 'one item' on the upper left in the picture above.  Note the price.  Now, do the math for the other ingredients you'll need.


Thirdly, traditional Japanese ingredients may be difficult for you to obtain, depending on where you live.  When you do find them, they tend to be on the expensive side (i.e. the unavoidable law of supply and demand).  You cannot substitute unagi (eel) with a piece of hot dog, hoping to achieve a similar taste.

I'd say the one exception to the above would be if you're making it for a big party and a large quantity makes sense.

However, if money is no object and you're up for an adventure, then by all means, go for it!  At least you'll be able to say you've done it.  Who knows?  It might be fun!

I've tried to make sushi at home several times, the above conclusion is what I came to.  I haven't tried it again since then.

But if you are not a connoisseur, you can’t understand chef’s skill anyway.
From the chef’s stand point, when a customer ordered a fried egg first, he’ll be nervous or upset because he knew his skill is examined.
As you know you have to be very careful to order sushi which is categorized as “market price.” Sushi chef can charge you from $2.00 to $20.00 for two pieces of sushi depending on his feeling. If you make him upset, the charge might be very high.

8) Sit as close to the chef in a place you can place your orders directly. The time needed to make a set in a lacquer tray can be as much as 15 minutes. Note the drying effect on the top of each sushi, and the effort to keep it moist with water or oil spray. Foggeddaboutit, order and eat direct.
9) Our local 天下一 revolving sushi is on par with all but the fancy ¥10,000 for the intro set places in the guidebooks. Foggeddabout it. Keep it local, go to the same place often enough, and you get that extra nod, that extra bit of delicious.
10) Do NOT become a hipster Monocle style I flew in from LA for the weekend with my lawyer just because we got a reservation at Jiro’s. Oh, so vain.
Get a life.

51,"It isn’t a question of etiquette.
Different types of fish taste best with different levels of wasabi. The delicate taste of lean white fish is easily overpowered, so a little dab will do ‘ya. Chewy shellfish can stand up to a more generous serving.
That’s why it’s a bad idea to mix wasabi in with the soy sauce. You’ll get the same hit with ikura — salmon eggs, which are best plain — as with rich negi toro, which benefits from the astringency of the green stuff.
With nigiri sushi the master will apply the wasabi for you, between the fish and the shari (vinegar rice). If you then add some of your own you risk removing the top of your head, and drowning out the taste of everything else.
You’re on your own with sashimi. In this case, put small dollops on a few places on the fish before lightly dipping the underside in soy sauce. This allows you to control the amount of wasabi each morsel is given, and ensures there aren’t any “hotspots” on your tongue that lose all sensation and the will to live.
Personal preferences obviously vary, so don’t be afraid to tell the master if you like a light hand on the wasabi. You can also request a heavy hand, though this could suggest you think the taste of his fish needs to be covered up. It therefore might be more polite (etiquette wise!) to say you love wasabi, and ask for a small dish so that you can add some extra on your own.
Bon apetit!

52,"Marcus’ answer isn’t a lie. It’s his take on eating top-tier sushi. His opinion that it “shouldn’t be a regular meal” and should only be “expensive” is certainly interesting, and I doubt that it’s shared by many Japanese. Where I live, going out for “good sushi” is rare with the majority of family sushi experiences taking place at the local conveyor-belt place. My wife and I go for “good” sushi every couple of months when we can get away from the kids for an evening, but we’re just talking the local “good” place. The wasabi is there of course, but you have to self-soy so I’m sure Marcus wouldn’t approve.
Anyway, I don’t get the impression that many people “lie.” I think that some people, especially those who either haven’t lived in Japan, or only lived for a short time, simply don’t understand as much as they think they do. In my experience, these also tend to be people who don’t speak the language.
Another mistake seems to be people who forget that the culture across Japan changes from place to place. I often discuss things from my own experience, and therefore preface things with “In Kansai…” etc. For example, if you lived in Iwate and learned about bowing to stopped car before crossing the street, you might mistake that for a “Japanese” thing, but it isn’t common across the majority of Japan.
Anyway, I think most people are just trying to be helpful. We can only hope that they are giving accurate information.

53,"LOL, I thought this was about making it, and I was going to suggest chirashi zushi, which is a kind of rice pilaf with room temperature sushi rice instead of buttered rice. It is also all cooked, so there’s cooked egg, reconstituted mushroom, simmered gobo, carrots julienned, and other ingredients.
Now that I see it’s about eating it, it depends on where you live. If you live in an area with an Asian community, there are a variety of different takes on sushi, including Chinese and Korean sushi. There’s also “American” sushi as well, which is mostly cooked fish.
If you are intimidated by raw fish, just get the items with cooked ingredients.
Inari - a fried pocket of tofu, seasoned with something salty and sweet. It’s a savory, almost candy-like flavor. If you like teriyaki, you may like this.
Avocado - a new sushi, and I think it’s fantastic. There’s also the California Roll, which uses avocado, fake crab, and cucumber. I really like avocado sushi.
Cucumber roll - one of my favorites. There’s also the avocado-cucumber roll, which is good. At least I like it. It’s bland, rich with oil, and crunchy.
Pickled daikon - takes a little getting used to, but it’s a pickled radish that’s sweet.
Egg - a mildly sweet egg rectangle on rice.
Pickled mackerel (saba) - if you like sardines, you might like this one. If you like pickled herring, you will love this one. One of my favorites, and I like pickled herring a lot, to the point of eating an entire jar at one sitting.
Fried shrimp roll - a fried tempura shrimp in a rice roll. It’s ok. Not one I ever really order for myself.
Lox - you might be able to get smoked salmon in a roll or on a rice ball. It’s lox. How can you go wrong?
Cooked shrimp - I guess it is OK. Raw is better.
Cooked octopus - I don’t think this is a good option for beginners. It’s cooked, but almost seems raw. Also, I think octopi are pretty intelligent… so it feels wrong.
Futomaki - thick roll. This is the traditional Japanese idea of sushi. Egg, spinach, shrimp powder, shiitake mushroom, gobo, all rolled. It’s umami, salty, and sweet, and also tastes earthy.
