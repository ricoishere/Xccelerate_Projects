1,"The Potters were extremely rich. They inherited the Peverell fortune and they consistently added to it over the years due to their many inventions and products; plus, various Families, such as the Fleamonts, married into them, thus making them even richer. And then there was the pièce de resistance of Fleamont Potter, Harry's paternal grandfather, starting up various companies, and amongst them was Sleekeazy's Hair Care and Scalp Treament, which quadrupled the Potter wealth before he sold the business, thus tripling the family fortune yet again. That substantial vault that Harry owned? Number 687? That was merely Harry's Trust Fund Vault. Harry had another, much bigger one deeper inside Gringotts.
Plus, everything that the Potters owned, they earned. They were honest businessmen and businesswomen. They did not do backroom deals. They did not buy, sell, or trade on the black market. They did not steal. They did deal Sith Dark artifacts or poisons. They did not cheat anybody out of their wealth. They did not break the law. The Malfoys, however, did so on a regular basis, as did the various other Dark families.
So you must ask yourself, did the Potters' honest and noble way of earning money allow them to outearn a selfish, greedy family like the Malfoys? Perhaps, perhaps not. However, the Potters, unlike the Malfoys, did not care about wealth and status. They gave freely to those who needed it more than they did and they did not rub their success into other people's faces. They also did not throw lavish parties or bribe Ministry officials into passing laws. So, thanks to the Malfoy's extremely lavish lifestyle, it could, very well, have all been balanced out.
However, Sirius Black died, and he left *EVERYTHING* he owned, including the *entire* Black fortune, to Harry. The Black family was the most notorious family in Wizarding Britain. They were rich enough to earn Order of Merlins through bribery. They owned several mansions. They were probably the most illustrious family out of all of the old, Dark, pureblood-espousing “Houses.” And like the Malfoys, the Blacks stole, they blackmarketed, they Muggle-baited, they manipulated, they connived, they lied. They were *not* honest businessmen. Their wealth *had* to have been, at the very least, comparable to the Malfoys. And Harry inherited it all.
So, to answer your question, harry is *definitely* the wealthiest. He has not just the entire Potter Family fortune, but also that of the Blacks. For that reason, he could very well be the richest person in Magical Britain and Ireland.
The Malfoy's, meanwhile, probbaly had their fortune decimated by Voldemort and the Ministry. If you don't think Voldemort had Lucius write the Wizarding equivalent of blank checks for him, think again. Those Snatchers, werewolves, and bounty hunters had to have been paid somehow and I doubt he made his favorite followers pay them. Also, do you really think that Kingsley Shacklebolt and the others would allow the Malfoy's to get away scott free? Nope. Not a chance.
So yes, Harry definitely comes out on top.

2,"I’ve got three - as far as I see, none of them have been mentioned before.
1. The Trio’s names
Harry Potter = Otter
Ron Weasley = Weasel
Hermione Granger = Ermine
Ron is a pureblood, who shares the name Weasel with his whole family. Harry is a halfblood, who inherited the name Otter from his wizard father, but doesn’t share the name with his muggle relatives, the Dursleys. Hermione is a muggleborn, who got her animal in her first name, and doesn’t share it with her parents. The otter, the weasel and the ermine all belong in the same family, called mustelidae, which comes for the latin word for weasel. Both Harry and Hermione ends up marrying into the weasel family.

2. Quidditch parallels the Battle of Hogwarts
There’s a big fight going on. People are scoring goals, trying to knock out their opponents and keeping their own players safe. But what really matters is one player on each team: the Seekers, or Harry and Voldemort. They never truly participate in this big fight. The Seekers are searching for the golden snitch, Harry’s searching for the last horcruxes, Voldemort’s searching for the Elder wand, and then waiting for Harry in the forest.
And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.
Harry and Voldemort, or the Seekers, are the only one who can beat each other, not because of destiny, but because of unwritten rules. The game only ends when one of the seekers beats the other - the Battle of Hogwarts ends immediately after Voldemort’s death - and unless the rest of the people on side have performed very badly compared to the other, their side will win.
3. The colors of their eyes
Red is the color of Voldemort’s eyes, Harry’s Hogwarts house (Gryffindor) and Harry’s signature spell (Expelliarmus).
Green is the color of Harry’s eyes, Voldemort’s Hogwarts house (Slytherin) and Voldemort’s signature spell (Avada Kedavra).
Red and Green are also opposite colors on the color wheel.
Of course, this is ruined by the movies, where both Harry and Voldemort have blue eyes.

3,"Taken as a whole, there’s only one thing that we all have in common.
Really, we are a very varied bunch. We don’t share an age, a reading style, a nationality, a gender, or a brain.
Some of us have read all the books and seen all the movies. Others have only seen the movies or only read some of the books or any combination of those two.
Our favourite character may be Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, Fred, Ginny, George, Sirius, Remus, Dobby, or Luna. Or someone else entirely.
Our favourite book may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
We may find Hermione annoying, or Ron bratty, or Ginny under-written, or Harry weak, but then again we may feel the reverse is true.
Our favourite description of food may be the Christmas feast, the chocolate frogs, the pumpkin juice, the butterbeer, or Florean’s ice cream sundaes. Or something else entirely.
Our favourite House may be Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, or Ravenclaw.
We may love Snape and see him as a hero, or a bully, or both.
Our favourite teacher may be McGonagall, Snape, Dumbledore, Hooch, or Hagrid. Or someone else entirely.
If we’ve read or seen The Cursed Child, we may love it or loathe it or find it problematic but interesting.
Our favourite spell may be expelliarmus, Ginny’s bat bogey hex, riddikulus, or sectumsempra. Or something else entirely.
Our favourite game may be Gobstones, Wizarding Chess or Quidditch.
However, I would suggest that we all share one feeling:
We all hate Umbridge.

4,"It depends.
Not all Snape fans are annoying
Not all James fans are annoying
Not all Draco fans are annoying
Not all (insert character here) fans are annoying
Also, I feel like on a website such as Quora, where you can block/mute the person, being annoyed is a pointless endeavour. It won’t make them change their mind. If you do get annoyed, and you choose not to mute that person from your feed, and you keep complaining about how much they’re annoying you, everytime you see their “trash” answers, the problem is you, not them.
Basically people will cease to be annoying, when you silence them using the tools that Quora has given you. This is a basic concept a lot of people don’t seem to get.
Which is why I’ve stopped commenting on answers I find distateful. I mute them and I move on. I have no interest, nor want to waste my time, trying to convince someone to change their mind. The chances that I would change their mind, especially if they hate my fave, is unlikely. Why bother?
What I find ridiculous in this fandom in general is character comparison.
If someone said: Snape should be nice. I know it’s more difficult for him to be nice because of his GENES (Harry and Snape don’t have the same genes) and his ENVIRONMENT. But that doesn’t mean that he can’t be nice. It just means it would require more conscious effort from him.
^ I wouldn’t find that annoying.
If someone said: Snape should be nicer, because Harry was also abused and Harry was nice.
^I find that annoying. How can you even compare the two? Harry was:
well provided for from his parent’s, Snape was not.
Harry was admired by most of the wizarding world, Snape was not.
Harry was at worse average looking and at best good looking, Snape was not.
Harry has different genes to Snape.
If you’re going to call Snape out for not being nice, you can do it in general, without bringing Harry into it; or trying to play abuse olympics. Where all victims have to turn out the same way.
The thing is Snape being abused had an affect on his later personality. It’s ridiculous to say “Snape being abused had nothing to do with him not being nice, because Harry was nice. He was only mean because that’s just who he was as a person” is an ignorant argument.
Remember their circumstances weren’t exactly the same, and Snape being abused would affect him differently, because of different DNA.
If someone said: James was a much better person than Snape or Snape was a much better person than James.
^I would find that to be a matter of taste
If someone said:
James was a:
bully to a nazi who was equally aggressive to him
a prankster
saved the life of an enemy
provided for his friends
became an illegal animagus to support his friend
fought for a minority group
gave his life for his family
Then they say Snape was a:
Nazi
Who sent a killer after a baby
Who wanted James and Harry dead so he could have Lily all to himself
Who only saved lives because he was obsessed with Lily
Is that a fair comparison? Some of those statements are not canonically accurate. Of course you can personally interpret the story anyway you want, but usually when discussing the books we try to keep to objective canon, whilst making it clear that our interpretations are only interpretations, not fact.
There is no right or wrong way to interpret the story, if you want to believe Snape murdered people for the fun of it, then by all means do so. But if you’re going to compare two characters, at least make sure the ground rules of comparison for both characters are the same.
My ground rules for character comparison are: (using James and Snape as an example)
Ground rule 1: For all the bad the two characters did, if I seek “virtuous” reasons for Snape’s bad, then I will do the same for James. Because it’s not fair to provide virtuous reasons for one character and not the other. Virtuous in quotes, because it’s not necessarily virtuous, just less non-virtuous.
Example:
Snape called muggleborns mudblood out of self-defence (I am headcanoning Snape’s behaviour).
James hurt Snape out of revenge for trying to get his friends expelled, not leaving his vulnerable friend with an illness alone, and for calling muggleborns mudblood (also a headcanon).
^The point is it’s a fair comparison, becaue I am headcanoning “virtuous” reasons for both of them. I’m not giving one “virtuous” reasons and the other non-virtuous reasons.
Ground rule 2: If I give James non virtuous reasons for all his bad behaviour (where the text is silent, and readers are required to headcanon) then I must do the same for Snape.
Example:
Snape called muggleborns mudblood because he was a nasty blood prejudiced little cunt.
James bullied because he was an abusive piece of crap
^The point is it’s a fair comparison, because I’m headcanoning non-virtuous reasons for both of them. It’s also a fair comparison, because I’m insulting them both equally.
If I headcanoned all “virtuous” reasons for Snape’s bad behaviour, but headcanoned all non-virtuous reasons for James’ bad behaviour, how would that be fair?
Ground rule 3: If I don’t go into detail for James, then I don’t go into detail for Snape.
Example:
James was a:
bully - I’m not going into detail about the kind of bullying he did.
Snape was a:
bully - I’m not going into detail about the kind of bullying he did.
^this is fair, because I’m not going into detail for both of them.
It would be unfair if I said that James was a bully, but then I went into full detail about how Snape was a child’s worse fear, tried to poison his toad, shoved Harry to the floor etc.
Either I fully detail both their good and bad right down to the last detail or I summarize both their good and bad. It wouldn’t be fair if I fully detailed the bad of Snape but not James to make James look better or vice versa.
I don’t like character comparison because most fans don’t have any ground rules when they compare two characters (usually James and Snape or Regulus and Snape or Harry and Snape or Draco and Snape). Without ground rules they can unintentionally or intentionally come out with unfair comparisons.

5,"I present to you one exchange, from book five, chapter one:
“Hey, Big D!”
Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all of his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago—”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true…”
[…]
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That— that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were, you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time…”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out—”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.”

6,"What’s wrong with Ron? He was hilarious, I think Hermione would do well with a laid-back guy to help her relax more.
Ron had his weaknesses but I think his good moments overshadowed his bad ones. I mean, think about it. He was a pureblood. He could have easily hidden behind his pureblood status and not fight in the war at all. Unlike Harry and Hermione, Ron never had to participate in the war, yet he STILL chose to risk his life and the lives of his family members. That shows some amazing bravery and strength of character right there. I think that a lot of people overlook Ron’s sacrifices.

7,"Ron haters will just say anything that comes to mind. In reality, there is more evidence that Hermione would be an abusive wife than that Ron would be an abusive husband. At least, Ron never physically assaulted Hermione, while Hermione physically assaulted him TWICE. (once with the birds in HBP and once in DH)
Of course, I am not saying that Hermione is generally abusive, I am just pointing it out to show how ridiculous the notion is that Ron would be an abusive husband.

8,"Ok, I would understand this question if it was asked about Sirius and Snape. I personally love both those characters, but as two fleshed out, well-rounded, flawed characters who actually had a rivalry/fight that spanned 3 books, I can see how people might argue about who is better in that particular vs. But James?
I seriously do not understand all of the consternation in the fandom about James. He's a comma in the book. A plot device made to further the character development of Harry, Sirius and Snape, but never really be a concrete, well laid out character himself. He's more of an idea of a character, than a full bodied character. How can you love or hate him? How can you feel strongly about him at all? You might as well be arguing about who you love or hate between Justin Finch-Fletchly and Ernie MacMillan or Hannah Abbot and Pansy Parkinson, I think they were more developed characters.
I think anyone who really LOVES James (and can say more than ""my curiosity is piqued by the brief glimpses we get of James and how he relates to Harry, Sirius and Snape, and gosh darn it, I would like to know more about this individual. Please JK, give us the Mauraders era Netflix show we are all clamoring for...."") loves James BECAUSE of the fandom and fan fiction, and as a off -shoot love of Harry. Not because they know anything about the character of James at all.

9,"He likely grew up, against all odds, to be a slightly better man than his father.
But he might have had to struggle. Upon deciding to be a better person, he discovers he is at odds with every friend he's ever known, and even his own father.
Petunia, perhaps a tad more emotionally aware than her husband, and a woman who dotes upon her son, may notice the difference and support Dudley, and as Dudley starts getting into more fights with Vernon, Petunia will take Dudley's side against her husband. A wedge between husband and wife will develop.
Dudley will seek out better friends at his new school, people who remind him more of his cousin Harry, but that won't be easy for him. These better quality friends will not fail to notice that Dudley is just not as practiced in kindness, thoughtfulness, or social fluency as a lad his age aught to be, and a little too quick to resort to violence in an attempt to defend his new friends. His jokes are just a tad inappropriate and fall flat. His expressions of kindness come off as awkward and miss the mark. At first, at least, he is more tolerated than fully accepted. But he is tolerated. His new friends can tell he is trying and he is not really a bad sort. They have more generosity and patience than his last lot of friends.
Dudley has many lonely years. He writes to his cousin Harry occasionally, and while Harry is kind enough to respond, he knows that Harry will never fully see him as a brother, which he secretly longs for. He wonders if his loneliness is worth being a better person.
He knows that it is. This is his penance, and when he remembers who he used to be, he cringes. He will never be that bully boy again, that empty, cowardly, cruel person. He would rather die.
And as he gets older, he gets better, he does eventually catch up with his peers. He will never be an intelligent man, but he does get better at making friends. He takes other reformed bullies under his wing, he makes good friends who appreciate him, he even eventually falls in love and gets married.
She is no great beauty, but Petunia adores her daughter-in-law. Vernon had long since given up on Dudley and doesn't have much to do with her. They have one son, and Harry comes over with his kids to meet Harold. They love their new baby muggle cousin and think uncle Dudley is funny and makes them laugh.
Vernon tries to take an interest in his grandson but Dudley won't let him have any influence over Harold.
Harold Dursley, with a better start in life in the area of family and humanity than Dudley had, is also a slightly better man than his father, and has an easier time of it. Dudley is thrilled by this and dotes upon Harold, but not in the same way that he was doted on. He is a bit more careful to give Harold some direction. Harold, he considers, is his redemption. His making up for the cruelty and pain he caused in his younger days.
When Harold grows up and has kids, he has twin daughters. One of the daughters seem to be able to cause strange things to happen around her. It reminds Harold of some stories his grandmother and father told about some other relatives. On his daughters' eleventh year, one of them receives a letter…

10,"The Goblet of Fire debacle. Yes, it worked but it has to be the dumbest plan ever. How did that strategy session go?
Voldemort: We must kidnap Harry Potter. There’s no apparating at Hogwarts and he’s protected against magic at the Dursley’s! Any ideas?
Pettigrew: Muggles love gold and Lucius is rich. Hire a muggle to kidnap him from the Dursleys without magic.
Voldemort: Your idea has merit but you’re ugly. Someone else?
Crabbe Sr.: I could hit him with a stick. He’s not protected against sticks and I’ve got one. Accio stick!
Voldemort: Crabbe’s plan is muggley and boring. I need a plan that’s magical and exciting.
Bellatrix: Potter goes to Hogsmeade every weekend. It’s outside the “no apparating” zone. I can make a portkey - with magic - and I can go to Hogsmeade in disguise and get Potter to touch it. That’s exciting because… erm… I know! It’s exciting because the portkey is attached to my bra!!!
Voldemort: I can’t risk any of you being seen in Hogsmeade even in disguise.
Crouch: I can make a polyjuice potion. I could look like a villager, a student or a shopkeeper! I could sell Potter the portkey! Oh, the magically exciting irony!
Voldemort: Fools! Obviously, if we’re going to attack Potter outside the no apparating zone, we have to send someone inside the no apparating zone. One of you must infiltrate Hogwarts.
Lucius: Your logic is unique and amazing, my lord.
Voldemort: Thank you.
Pettigrew: Sirius got in as an animagus last year so we know that works. I’m an animagus and I know all about the secret tunnels from being a Marauder.
Voldemort: Yes, but you’re still ugly.
Bellatrix: The quidditch pitch is outside the no apparating zone. I could use polyjuice to look like a student, sneak into Hogwarts before a quidditch practice, and replace the snitch with one that’s actually a portkey. I could enchant it so only Harry can catch it.
Lucius: Even simpler: Draco could snitch the switches. Switch the snitches. Ha-ha! Who knows which witch switched which snitch-
Voldemort: Crabbe, Lucius would like a closer look at that stick of yours. (*Lucius falls to the ground with a dull thud*) Excellent. Now, the way to be absolutely sure of success is to have one of you inside Hogwarts in disguise for a long period of time surrounded by our cleverest and most powerful deadly enemies.
Crouch: Hmm. Well, if we have to, Filch is easy to overpower since he’s a squib. He’s a loner and an eccentric so no one will notice odd behavior. He wanders everywhere and nobody ever questions him. He’d be ideal.
Voldemort: Better yet, the new Dark Arts professor: Alastor Moody.
Bellatrix: Alastor Moody the powerful auror who’s famous for capturing people like us? Who’s always suspicious, always on his guard and has a magic eye that sees through everything?
Voldemort: Yes. We capture him alive, polyjuice Crouch to look like him and then Crouch will smuggle Moody, still alive, into Hogwarts, keep him captive and use him to constantly renew his supply of the difficult and time-consuming to make polyjuice potion which he’ll need to take several times daily. He can simply steal the other polyjuice ingredients from under Snape’s watchful eye over and over again for as long as he’s there.
Crabbe Sr.: Would it help if I hit Snape with my stick?
Voldemort: No. And stop waving it around. Better yet, use it to knock yourself senseless.
Crabbe Sr.: OW! OW! OW!
Voldemort: Quietly.
Crabbe Sr.: ow. ow. ow.
Pettigrew: We could buy the ingredients and give them to Crouch in Hogsmeade. In fact we could probably mail them.
Voldemort: Ugly, much?
Pettigrew: You know what? I’ll be over there on my exercise wheel if anyone needs me.
Crouch: Snape is a Death Eater and he’s a genius at making potions. He could give me the ingredients. He could help me to make the potions.
Voldemort: I trust him but it’s too risky. Constant stealing is safer.
Bellatrix: Doesn’t that mean we’re irretrievably screwed if Snape runs out of anything we need?
Voldemort: Yes, but we’ll hope that doesn’t happen.
Crouch: Good. Crisis averted. I’m totally fine with betting my life on Snape’s inventory management and his willingness to be repeatedly plundered. Moving right along. I will impersonate Moody, win Harry’s trust and wait for an opportunity to slip him a portkey outside Hogwarts grounds. It could take a while but we’ll probably have him in a few weeks.
Voldemort: No, simpleton! It’s the Triwizard Tournament this year. First, you must jinx the Goblet of Fire.
Crouch: The unfoolable tamper-proof Goblet of Fire? Do we even know I can do that?
Voldemort: Yes, because you’re that good. Make the Goblet pick Harry to be in the TriWizard tournament.
Crouch: I make Harry one of the three champions who will be the constant focus of everyone’s attention?
Voldemort: No, that’s the genius of my plan. You make him the fourth champion.
Crouch: Then won’t everyone know for sure that I screwed with the Goblet and it’s not just some age exception for “The Chosen” or something?
Voldemort: Correct.
Crabbe Sr.: Am I senseless yet?
Bellatrix: With you, it’s impossible to tell.
Crouch: My lord, there’s only a short time between the Goblet arriving and the champions being selected. If they discover the jinx within 5 hours, they can use a time turner to catch me red handed.
Voldemort: True, but maybe they won’t think of that.
Crouch: Brilliant, my lord. Thanks for plotting that out for me. Next question: how does this help us to kidnap Potter?
Voldemort: You will make sure the last trial is a maze on the quidditch pitch and that the Triwizard Cup in the centre of the maze is a portkey to port the winner back to the start. You will ensure that Potter wins the trial and is first to touch the Cup without the judges or Harry himself suspecting anything.
Bellatrix: Ah! I see the plan: Barty will remove the original portkey spell and replace it with a new one that will take Potter to our secret location.
Voldemort: No. Instead of replacing the original portkey spell, he will add a second spell on top of the first. That way, we can return the Cup after we’re done with it. I think there’s a deposit or something. Probably Potter won’t touch the Cup a second time and escape.
Crouch: Wait, you said the last trial. As in: I have to be undercover for the entire school year and I have to start the year by tipping everyone off that there’s a powerful dark wizard undercover inside Hogwarts who is after Harry Potter.
Voldemort: Correct.
Crouch: Oh joy, I’m correct again. Here’s a thought: Dumbledore is an old pal of Moody’s and knows him really well. My freaking father is going to be there too and he knows me really well. How do I avoid either of them blowing my cover for a whole year?
Voldemort: You’ll think of something.
Crouch: That sounds foolproof. Let’s make sure I have this straight: I jinx the Goblet to pick Harry and three crippled idiots he can easily beat-
Voldemort: No need to do that. Three regular champions will be just fine.
Crouch: But if I’m messing with the Goblet anyway-
Voldemort: Are you defying me?
Crabbe Sr.: Shall I hit him with my stick?
Crouch: My lord, I’m simply trying to clarify the brilliant details of your brilliant scheme. So Harry must defeat three older and better qualified champions. Fine. I befriend him and give him help and advice the way Lupin did last year-
Voldemort: That was last year. This year it would arouse suspicion. Instead, befriend other people, give them information and then make them help Harry. That won’t arouse suspicion.
Crouch: Right. And I can make the trials play to Harry’s strengths: broom racing, snitch catching, best essay on “dark lords I have known”.
Voldemort: Suspicion again! Jinxing the Goblet, making the last trial a maze on the quidditch pitch and tampering with the Cup won’t arouse suspicion. Influencing the other two trials will arouse suspicion. Do you follow me?
Crouch: Like a vulture following a wounded gnu, my lord. It’s just… look, Moody has a prosthetic leg. What if I turn the boot into a portkey, wait for the right opportunity, and kick Potter right in the-
Voldemort: I have spoken!
Bellatrix: I wonder if, hypothetically speaking, someone could have a massive brain aneurysm and not notice. I mean, they still think they’re okay but they’re mostly dead meat from the neck up.
Crabbe Sr.: I could walk over to Potter’s, hit him with my stick, and bring him back in time for tea.
Bellatrix: I can see Crabbe’s lips moving and yet it sounds like the best idea I’ve heard all day.
Voldemort: Why are you still here, Crouch? Hop to it! Moody’s not going to capture himself.
Crouch: Sadly, no. Goodbye, everyone. Don’t forget to give Peter his seed pellets.
Bellatrix: Goodbye, Barty. It was nice knowing you. Look on the bright side. At least we won’t be referring to you as “the crazy one” now.
POSTSCRIPT
First and foremost: I had no idea this post would be so popular. Thank you for more than 2,000 upvotes! I hope it made you smile.
Secondly, please please do not let this “ruin” the book for you. The book has great characters, fun dialog, and a cool mystery to solve. I tease my wife, I tease my daughter, and I like to poke fun at books I enjoy. This was written in the spirit of good-natured fun.
Third and least important, this was originally conceived with three characters: Voldemort, Pettigrew, and Barty Junior. In the book these were the only people Voldemort trusted with his secret (if you follow extended canon then Nagini might possibly be included as a person). All the schemes discussed above work with only Barty and Peter. When I started writing it out, it started to sound repetitive so I threw in some more characters to make it more fun. Bellatrix, as several people have pointed out, was in Azkaban. But I happen to like Bellatrix and, as I say, I really had no idea this would be so popular so I put her in. If I’d been thinking, I would have made her “live via satellite” or something. Oh well.
There are some interesting discussions in some of the comment threads as to the mechanics of some of this. I did spend some time thinking out how this would go. I love speculating and theorizing. Happy Pottering.

11,"The effects of a Love Potion, as Ron’s example from Half-Blood Prince shows, are as follow:
Personality loss for as long as the Potion acts. (Ron’s personality basically became “I love Romilda Vane” with nothing else)
Obsessive focus on the person who administers the Potion
Loss of inhibition
Memories remain intact after the “love sickness” is cured
Which means that Tom Riddle Senior was not only raped for months on end, but the second he was freed from the influence of Merope’s Love Potion, he could remember every single thing that had happened to him while under its influence.
Staying behind for the sake of the baby might be a noble thing to do but… honestly? No one can blame Tom Sr for getting the hell out of here. He was the victim. He’s the one who got raped. He doesn’t owe a thing to Merope. No one should owe anything to their rapist/abuser.
Tom Sr was perhaps a jerk in life, but he was still a victim of rape and he left his rapist as soon as he was freed from her control. Merope might be the character with the unhappiest life in the whole series, but even if she was suffering from a mental illness (which probably isn’t a wild assumption since the Gaunts are physically deformed due to their inbreeding so their internal organs must have been pretty screwed up as well) she still raped a man.
So, no. Tom Riddle Sr was entirely justified in leaving Merope.

12,"At the very start of the Half-blood Prince, Dumbledore takes Harry with him to convince a retired professor to return to teaching.
They have a brief exchange, over a minor concern of Harry’s.
Towards the end of the same book, there’s an often quoted scene. Harry has watched Dumbledore torture himself to get to the bottom of the cup and get the horcrux. Weakened, Harry begins to take him back to Hogwarts.
These lines stand by themselves, a reflection of how the student-mentor relationship has changed as Harry matured. They are proof of how entirely Dumbledore places faith in the boy, but also how Harry grew up so quickly, to the point where he is taking care of his headmaster.
However, very rarely is the connection between the earlier quote made. Together, they become full circle, showing how Harry has very much become the older man’s equal.

14,"If I was rooming with someone and we both had pets and that other person’s pet KILLED mine after multiple times I’d told the roomie to PLEASE restrain their pet or something, I’d be pissed as fuck too.
Scabbers turning out to be Wormtail narratively absolved Hermione of responsibility she, as a pet owner who shares a dorm with OTHER pet owners, should have had.
Crookshanks’ introduction was in chasing Scabbers and hunting him. Every single scene with that cat up until the climax had to with him hunting Scabbers.
Here, let me put this in another scenario: let’s say that kneazles eat owls and rabbits for the sake of argument. If Crookshanks tried to hunt Hedwig and Lavender’s bunny (again, for the sake of argument, let’s say it’s there) and then there’s evidence that Crookshanks ate them or at least injured them badly enough to draw a disturbing amount of blood, are Lavender and Harry then supposed to shrug their shoulders and accept it? ESPECIALLY if they’d been telling Hermione for MONTHS in every language known to man to please, for the love of Merlin, control her cat before it really does hurt their own pets?
Yeah, no, I really don’t see much reconciliation happening. Especially if Hermione acts like she did nothing wrong in neglecting her duties as a pet owner to restrain her cat from eating/attacking her dorm-mates’ pets.
Even if Hermione apologized, I foresee Harry STAYING angry for a lot longer than weeks. And it would’ve been his right, just like it was Ron’s right to be angry.
All Ron wanted was a damn apology and for Hermione to admit she was wrong and for her can it with her self-entitled attitude of “it’s not my or Crookshanks’ fault he has hunters’ instincts!”
Mate, if you’ve been sharing a dorm with someone who has a pet for two years and then get a pet yourself that is a predator to your dorm-mate’s pet, it’s YOUR responsibility to make train/make sure your pet doesn’t harm your dorm-mate.
This is basic dorm-mate and cohabitation etiquette 101.
Even if Harry is feeling neutral because it was not HIS pet that was eaten, he still acknowledges that Ron has a reason to be pissed and that it’s RON’S choice whether to forgive Hermione or not.
He can broach the subject with Ron and Ron responded that he won’t forgive Hermione until she apologizes.
Sure, Harry could’ve gone to Hermione and said “Ron is willing to forgive you if you apologize and mean it,” but Harry’s rather passive when it comes to these things. It comes down to his passive personality regarding friendships if the friends are fighting.

15,"Great question! This answer took a little bit of digging.
The answer is two-fold. Prior to attending school and receiving their wands, magical children still do magic. When they’re angry or scared or upset, especially, they can manifest magical happenings on their own. This is never punished, as kids don’t have control over it.
After getting her wand, Lily did receive several warnings. Here’s a quote from J.K. Rowling on her personal site, found in an archive.
“In ""Philosopher's Stone"" Aunt Petunia says that Lily came back from Hogwarts with frog spawn in her pockets and turned teacups into rats. If this is true, why wasn't Lily expelled?
Aunt Petunia is exaggerating a little; you have to allow for her state of mind when she started shrieking these things. However, just like her son, Lily was not averse to testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy, so you can safely assume she will have had a few warning letters – nothing too serious, though.”
Petunia’s distaste for magic probably developed early on — between her not being a full witch, herself, and Severus accidentally hitting Petunia with a tree branch (without a wand) after she had made fun of him.
So it seems like the Ministry of Magic was typically smart enough to tell the difference between “doing big obvious spells in front of Muggles” and “terrorizing her sister at home with small magical pranks.”
The Ministry canonically seemed to only really enforce the rule if the actions could expose Magic to Muggles — Petunia was part of the family, however, and so they knew she was already familiar with witches and wizards. The Evans parents were not magical, similarly to how Hermione Granger’s parents were not magical. Hermione claims to have successfully done spells before entering Hogwarts, and even does some on the train on the way there. She isn’t punished for any of this, to my knowledge.
To wrap up, the consensus is that it’s treated kinda like several modern Muggle laws — only enforced when it’s a serious offense that draws complaints, like jaywalking or using a barbecue grill within 14 feet of a structure.

18,"First of all, as someone who loves both Ron and Hermione dearly, I don’t think that she would done better than Ron by choosing Draco, Viktor or even Harry. I’m going to explain you why. I also put myself in her shoes and if you ask me something like that, I would be bothered, not to say that I would get angry and rightly so, for questioning my choices.
Hermione may chose Ron for these reasons:
He stands up for her when someone insults or tries to attack her. Like when he got attacked by Malfoy after insulting Hermione calling her a Mudblood or when he offers himself to be tortured by Bellatrix to keep Hermione safe.
Even if they bicker or argue almost daily for any reason, Hermione seems to care about Ron when he gets attacked (for example, when he almost dies in HBP) or misses him when he is away for a long time like in Deathly Hallows when Ron leaves her and Harry to deal with the locket. Same can be said about Ron when Hermione gets petrified by the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.
Ron is the only person of her age who actually stands her bossiness, her insensitive remarks and her other flaws, even if it exasperates him at some point and ends calling out her. Even if they fight a lot, he puts a sincere effort and his best to understand Hermione, thing that can’t be said about Harry. Same with Hermione when it comes about trying to comprehend Ron’s self-esteem issues, immaturity and childish behaviour until she gets annoyed and starts to nag him for that.
They get the best of each other when they are together. Hermione gets Ron to put some focus at school even if he is already smart while Ron will try make her laugh by saying something witty or stupid.
Hermione has a lot of flaws and so does Ron, but if it is there’s something that Hermione is not, is being an stupid and shallow woman or someone who is looking for a rich suitor, for certain. She is most likely to be a career-woman type who doesn’t need the money or being supported financially by her husband. If that were not the case, she would have married Draco, don’t you think?
Ron is not average and for certain, not poor after the war. Anyone who stands next to Hermione is average in academic terms but that does not mean exactly that Ron or Harry are dumber than her. Ron can be very smarter than most of his peers, like when he set the strategy during the giant chess play at Philosopher’s Stone ending.
Also, his family may be poor during his childhood and adolescence, but after the war and after being an Auror for some years, he got in charge of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with George which was a successful business and a money-spinner.
And last, Hermione loved the Weasleys because they welcomed her into the magical society.

20,"This is going to be fun. I’ve noticed that so much changes just by reversing the girls’ gender alone. Genders have been changed in the passages below.
""Has anyone seen a toad? Alice’s lost one,"" he said. He had a bossy sort of voice, bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
""We've already told her we haven't seen it,"" said Robin, but the boy wasn't listening, he was looking at the wand in her hand.
""Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.""
- - -
""Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.""
She waved her wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.
""Are you sure that's a real spell?"" said the boy. ""Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it
 will be enough -- I'm Henry Granger, by the way, who are you?”
- - -
Robin said, ""One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode.""
""Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have,"" said Henry nastily, picking up his quill again.
Male Hermione comes off as a bully. Check!
""Right,"" said Gilbert, tossing his red hair out of his face and glaring at Robin, ""let's get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Robin —
""Yeah, it is!"" said Robin, just as angrily. ""D'you think I want people saying my brother's a — ""
This passage would no longer be as effective if Ginny were a boy since the connotations of dating multiple people are considerably different between the genders. Gilbert Weasley would have gone scot-free.
“Beds empty! No note! Car gone ... could have crashed ... out of my mind with worry ... did you care? ... never, as long as I’ve lived ... you wait until your mother gets home, we never had trouble like this from Beatrice or Charlie or Phoebe ...’
‘Perfect Phoebe,’ muttered Freya.
‘YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PHOEBE’S BOOK!’ yelled Mr. Weasley, prodding a finger in Freya’s chest. ‘You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your mother her job –”
If Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s genders were reversed, Martin Weasley would be in so much more hot water for how overbearing and controlling he is.
“You thought I would not weesh to marry ‘er? Or per'aps you hoped?"" said François, his nostrils flaring. ""What do I care how she looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my wife is brave! And I shall do zat!"" he added fiercely, pushing Mr. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from him.”
François Delacour becomes infinitely more narcissistic yet sympathetic.
“Oh well…I’d just been thinking, if you had died, you’d have been welcome to share my toilet.”
Moaning Milton is no longer a sad ghost who lives in a toilet but a degenerate who spies on the girls’ bathroom.
“Deep down, you know that you deserve to be punished. Don’t you, Ms Potter?”
Dorian Umbridge would be ten times creepier, pink clothes and office included. His character would never have seen the light of day.
However, Oleander Brown wouldn’t be seen as clingy and annoying but unusually affectionate for a boy. Chen Chang would probably be praised for being so open with his feelings. Nicodemus “Nico” Tonks would be so much more fun (can you just imagine a young, spunky Hufflepuff man running around with bubblegum pink hair?). And Lorcan Lovegood would be just as awesome as ever, although his oddness would be less charming and a lot more weird.
It’s so strange to think how different these characters (the men included) would be if their genders were reversed and I didn’t go in expecting much but I was quickly proven wrong. Thanks for the thought exercise!

21,"I really wish there were more answers to this because I’d like to know what other people think. It’s one of those loose ends that Rowling has come up with in order to explain away her own plot holes, and for now, we’re stuck with this tripe:
“I think that for one moment she trembled on the verge of wishing Harry luck; that she almost acknowledged that her loathing of his world, and of him, was born out of jealousy. But she couldn’t do it; years of pretending that ‘normal’ was best had hardened her too much.""
—J. K. Rowling on what Petunia wanted to say shortly before her departure.
That doesn’t really fit, for me. It’s just another ‘explain away’, as I call it. I’m surprised she didn’t say it could be something that Rowling seems to think encompasses the most devastating and yet heartfelt statement in the book, “You have your mother’s eyes.”
For me personally, I feel this is a scapegoat phrase that’s supposed to irrevocably change people who’ve been nasty and cruel throughout the whole series into someone who does actually care a whole lot *cough* Snape *cough*, in spite of all their actions to the contrary.
Personally, though, I feel it would be something a little deeper, something that explains Petunia’s absolutely abhorrent treatment of a kid. I imagine it would go something like this:
She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: she gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech. When it finally burst forth it was as if she had lanced a wound that festered for years and years.
“I suppose you expect some sort of farewell, some sort of thank you?” she said waspishly.
Harry just looked at her. What could he say? Sixteen years had taught him not expect much of anything at all.
“How could she expect me to think of you as a son? How could she expect anything, when all she’s done is leave me behind?” The words came out in a restrained shriek. “Always she was leaving me. For that boy. For that freak school. For that worthless husband. And then she left me for good, and never could I follow.” Tears poured down her horsey face and she trembled.
Harry was staring at her, speechless.
“And you, staring at me with her eyes, following in her steps…how could I do anything but hate you? You’re a constant reminder that she…she left me!”
“She didn’t want to be murdered, you know,” Harry retorted, angry. “She chose to fight and she was killed for it. You should be proud!”
Petunia gave him a scathing look. “Proud of what? That she chose to go off and get herself blown up and land me with her freak son?”
Harry resisted the urge to strike at her. “You can’t fool me, I saw your face when you learned Voldemort was back, when Dudley and I were attacked. You’re scared, and you should be. She and my dad were some of the best of their age, and they weren’t strong enough to fight him. What chance do you think you’d stand?”
Petunia’s face went pale and her eyes welled with even more tears. “She died, and there’s nothing I can or could do about it. When I found out, when we got you…” her lip trembled and she sobbed, “I was so angry, because she’d gone again, where I couldn’t follow. And I hated her, because she was my s-sister and all she ever did was l-leave.”
Harry watched her break down with an odd crushing feeling in his stomach. “Why didn’t you ever say anything?”
His aunt looked at him with her swollen eyes and she swallowed, breathing hard. “Because now you’re leaving too. And I knew you would, I always knew you would,” she whispered.
Harry bit his lip and fought the sensation of burning in his eyes. Then Vernon stumped back in the room and grabbed his wife by the arm.
“Petunia! It’s time to go!” he bellowed, giving one final loathing-filled look at his nephew before dragging his wife out of the house.
Petunia’s eyes met Harry’s for the last time, and then she hid her face in her hands and left with her husband, leaving behind the nephew that had haunted her since her sister’s death.
But I don’t know. This is just what I would imagine. Hopefully some other people will come up with more answers.
Edit: The amount of kind and incredible comments on this is truly heartwarming. I was not expecting it. Thank you all so much.

22,"Hermione knows Ron is really overprotective when it comes to Ginny (and pretty much all his friends), and let’s admit it quickly - he was kind of rooting for her and Harry to end up together. At the end of Order Of The Phoenix, he quite obviously demonstrates that he considers Harry to be the only one “worthy” of his little sister. He dislikes Michael Corner because he considers him to be “not good enough” for Ginny. Ridiculous but eh, that’s an overprotective big brother for you.
Ron has a rather cute and naive conception of love - he can’t fathom that dating just for the sake of dating exists. To him, dating is between people who actually share something deeper than just snogging. He doesn’t understand why Ginny is dating other people despite her feelings for Harry. This wide-eyed innocence is what Ginny will exploit to hit where it hurts when they have their argument in Half-Blood Prince - because Ron believes that dating and kissing is something special, discovering that Hermione and Viktor had been involved together was the surefire way to break his heart, and his dreams of “true love” as well.

23,"Oh, tough one. This is going to sound terrible, but Molly Weasley. I used to love her mothering ways, and thought she managed her brood of seven (plus dad) quite well, but then I began to notice little, niggling things about Molly that bothered me.
As poor as the Weasleys were, she should have sent Ron a nice dress robe for the Yule Ball! How awful of her to send him something from one hundred years ago. And if she truly had no money to buy Ron decent clothes for his first big dance (with more to follow, so invest in those nice clothes), Molly could have done something, anything to earn extra money for their family! The kids were all away most of the year. Write articles on knitting for The Daily Prophet. Raise eggs for muggles. Knit ugly sweaters and sell them at a market, once a week. Anything! So her not helping the family with money rankles me.
Then she expects each child to be awesome, amazing and earn fantastic marks and Molly compares her children to one another! Charlie and Bill obviously performed very well at Hogwarts. When Ron was made prefect and Molly found out, she said this, while Fred and George stood nearby.
“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That’s everyone in the family!”
“What are Fred and I, next door neighbors?” said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.
“What until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful news. You could wind up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step!”
(emphasis mine)
Why would Molly do that? The twins wanted her approval also, and to make the products they did for their joke store, they had to be brilliant at magic. All sorts of magic. But Molly cares about her kids’ outward appearances. And this doesn’t even take into account what a prat Percy is being. He’s basically acting as if he is not a Weasley at all. But Molly is thinking only of titles and being made Head Boy. Ugh. I wouldn’t want Molly to be my mom. I’d want her to acknowledge the things I’m doing well, rather than going on about her good students in the house. Besides, every child is different. I cannot imagine that family having six Percys. Really? Yuk. And she hurt George with her comments and lavish praise.
Another thing… when it came to Sirius and Harry, Molly interfered severely and was completely OUT OF LINE! Yes, I’m shouting. Sorry. But Sirius was designated to be Harry’s godfather and Sirius is doing a fine job of it too, until Molly busted in and made nasty remarks about Sirius being stuck in Azkaban. Like the guy wanted to go there right after his best mate was killed! Let the man, be a man to a teenager boy left in his care. She gets too involved with Harry and insults Sirius way too much. Muzzle that woman, please.
“[Harry’s]’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly. “He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?” “He’s got me!” “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling, “the thing is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
Rude and mean.
And how would you like to marry into Molly’s family? Did you notice all the cruel things she said, nonstop, mind you, about Fleur Delacour? Molly loathed the woman who was marrying her son! Be nice to the girl! No wonder that they moved far away to Shell Cottage when they married. Because Molly made fun of her accent and never helped Fleur. And I’m quite sure Fleur noticed. She’s not a dolt. Fleur knew her mother-in-law to be hated her. What fun that would be? Molly should have made the effort to be kind and look for the good in her daughter-in-law! It was up to Molly to be the nice one. Fleur made efforts to land on Molly’s good side, but Molly wouldn’t have it. That still bothers me. Molly was plain out mean. And rude.
So there are a few of my reasons why I now dislike Molly Weasley. I did like her motherly ways once upon a time. But now? She gets on my nerves. She needs to work on being kinder. In my opinion only. I’m sure Molly Weasley has plenty of admirers.

25,"#1 In The Half Blood Prince, when Harry and Dumbledore are heading out to the cave to seek a horcrux that Tom Riddle might have placed in that cave, Harry tells Ron and Hermione not to worry about him, saying, “I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore.” And then after Dumbledore drinks all the poisonous potion in the basin inside that cave, he is terribly weak, having trouble breathing, and Harry really steps up and gets his Headmaster back to Hogsmeade (and Hogwarts), and Dumbledore, when Harry is trying to get them out of that cursed cave, says, to Harry, “I am not worried, Harry. I am with you.”
Both of them depend upon each other so much, and their saying so befuddled me. Why would a clever man such as Dumbledore find comfort in being with Harry, when he is at his weakest? Because Harry has proved time and again, through each challenge in every book, that he is extremely good at performing magic, off the cuff, improvising, and he gets out of the tight spots each time. Dumbledore knows the fact that Harry is an actual Horcrux. And cannot be destroyed/killed, without the Elder Wand or the sword of Griffindor. Or some other powerful and magical way that cannot be foreseen. He sees Harry’s tenacity and knows he is in good, capable hands, and he relies on Harry to get them back. (Dumbledore knows he is dying, but Harry doesn’t. Quite. He believes Madam Pomfrey or Snape can cure the poisoned Headmaster.) But Dumbledore saying he trusts Harry also gives Harry the confidence needed to carry on after his death, and Dumbledore knows this.
#2 I never believed Snape was on the right side. I didn’t. Dumbledore might have had faith in Snape, but throughout the books, each time, I thought Dumbledore was a mite too trusting, and I hated and loathed Snape. And he dies, Snape does. Then we see Harry take his memories to the Pensieve and I was utterly blown away by what was going on in Severus Snape’s life. He really did work for the Order. He really did want Voldemort to be defeated. And I was conflicted because Snape was never kind to Harry; the boy who ultimately would have to face and fight the Dark Lord. I kept thinking, if only Snape had been a little nicer to Harry, everyone’s life would have been better. The dichotomy between the double agent Snape and the Snape who loathes Harry because he looks so like James Potter amazed me. It made me sad. It also mimics real life, where people hold grudges for years. And they miss out on so much. Snape risked so much. But his life could have been better. If only…
#3 Ginny loved Harry from the beginning. She liked him so much that she couldn’t manage to speak to him in the first two books. Then she manages to talk a very little bit to him, and finally Ginny becomes her natural self and dates lots of other guys. Then Harry swoops in, finally, after Ginny and Dean break up, and Ginny tells Harry, “I never really gave up on you. Not really. I always hoped.” I like a good romance now and then, and Ginny and Harry together make so much sense. I was grateful to JKR for giving the Weasleys a little girl after having six boys. And Harry, who has absolutely no magical family to belong to, loves The Burrow and the Weasley family, and with Ginny, he gets to keep that family. He comes full circle, from being with all the Weasleys because Ron is his best friend, to marrying into the that family, which seals the bond for life. I like how JKR gave us glimpses of Harry’s and Ginny’s future together, throughout the books. The two of them crossed paths often, and I should have picked up on Ginny being the one for Harry, but I didn’t see until The Half Blood Prince. It took me six books to realize who Harry’s heart belonged to.
#4 Others have mentioned the foreshadowing, so I won’t go into that. But JKR really had a terrific timeline written down, since so many things are connected and we see that throughout the stories, the books.

26,"Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Justin tells Harry in Chamber of Secrets that his name was down for Eton, but that he’s glad he ended up at Hogwarts instead. This establishes him both as a muggle-born and as a toff (as if the surname wasn’t a big enough clue on that front).
A boy in that position should not be a calm kid placidly accepting and wondering at the magical world he finds himself in. A boy in that position should be a roiling ball of conflicting emotions.
His name was down for Eton. That’s a big deal. That means that from the year of his birth, his parents have been planning for him to go to Eton. His name implies that they’re Old Money, which means decent odds that they’re asset-rich but not necessarily cash-rich. They will have been budgeting their cash-flow from the day Justin was born with male genitalia for him to go to Eton (had he been born with female genitalia, they’d probably have been looking at Wycombe Abbey or Cheltenham Ladies’ College, where the costs and time-frame would have been different, so only once they knew gender could the true budgeting start).
Those parents will have been planning the future realisation of investments to meet the payment dates and amounts for Eton, payable from the year after Justin turned thirteen (not eleven, thirteen). Before that, they will have been paying smaller but still exorbitant amounts for him to attend a decent prep school from the age of 7; either as a day boy if there was a good school locally or, more likely in preparation for Eton, as a boarder.
Justin is then, at almost no notice, torn from this at the age of 11 and thrust into an entirely unexpected environment. His old friends will wonder what happened to him; though not all boys from his prep school will go on to Eton, they’ll mostly go to the big Public Schools. Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Marlborough, Radley, Abingdon, etc. They would all build up their school networks, then meet again at Oxford, Cambridge, the Royal Agricultural College (now University, but College for Justin’s age-group) and various other universities to create wider networks before going on to have major influence in whatever sphere they choose to work in, be it the public sector or the private sector. Their Old School Tie and the College Scarf would open the necessary doors for them.
Justin’s disappearance will be a mystery to his friends, and they’ll lose touch with him. Their parents will talk about the Finch-Fletchleys in hushed tones, assuming they’ve suffered some major financial disaster and that Justin’s not bright enough to make up for it by getting into Eton as a King’s Scholar. That will cause a massive strain on Justin’s parents, potentially ruining them socially and damaging their financial credit. Justin will notice that, and become cut off from his friends and family at a time when he should have been one of his parents’ biggest social assets. That will cause Justin guilt, however much he enjoys Hogwarts.
And why, exactly, does he enjoy Hogwarts more than he thinks he would have enjoyed Eton, and more than he enjoyed his prep school? For all JKR tells us magic is amazing, we don’t see it be particularly amazing; we see it as hard work and pointless danger in a world run by incompetents. Justin will have been accustomed to at least a facsimile of pastoral care at prep school, and most of them take sports quite seriously because they “build character”. Hogwarts’ pastoral care is shocking, and there’s no sport apart from quidditch, which is only played competitively by a tiny minority. And at the end of it, and he must have had a sense of this by his second year, Justin’s just going to be another muggle-born, with no connections to wizarding high society and no clear route into an influential or rewarding role.
Hogwarts never shows itself to be better than Eton, and definitely not enough to justify the complete destruction of Justin’s family life and his chances for the future.
Justin’s attitude to Hogwarts makes no sense.

27,"He was brave. He saved Snape despite hating him. He joined the Order to fight against evil even if he was not effected by the war. He stood by his family and went into hiding with them even if Harry was the target. He stood wandless against Voldermort to buy his family time to escape. He would willingly have died for them.
He was honorable and noble. Same points above. He was loyal. He stood by Remus when he found out Remus was a werewolf. He opened his home to Sirius. And he accepted Peter as part of his gang. And Remus’s comment about him considering it the height of dishonor makes it clear that he made Peter SK because he trusted him as a friend regardless of what some Snape fans try to twist.
He was self-sacrificing. He was willing to save even Snape who was his enemy at great risk of his life. He was willing to risk his life to attempt to protect his family. Sirius said he would have died for Peter, so he would have been willing to die for his friends too.
He wasn’t prejudiced against muggle-borns, werewolves and half-breeds. He was a good father/ husband / family man despite his young age.
He's funny. At least according to Rosmerta. And the muggle cop scene. I thought he was funny in the muggle cop scene. He's cheeky as also seen by the muggle cop scene. Given that Sirius and James are implied to be much alike, I'd assume James was as funny/ cheeky / daring as Sirius that we see throughout the books. I like that. I also love Sirius and the Weasley twins whom James us implied to be a lot like.
He was arrogant and a bully as a teen but he was said to have deflated his head and grown out of his bullying. He improved himself to be less arrogant and showy and stopped being a bully.
