As many of my followers know, I worked in the field that tightly interacted with dark web on a daily basis.
I have seen some interesting things there, however, I hate to be that guy, who comes to people and says: “well, folks, things that you have been told about dark web are mostly urban legends and lies”.
The most horrifying things are always related to violent child rape, but pardon me, I don’t want to discuss this topic, as it’s gruesome enough even to mention.
Nevertheless, I will share with you quite amazing and funny story.
One time, I came across several articles from largest US news channels about series of hacks and attacks on governmental databases in several countries across the globe. All large tabloids and political experts blamed “Russian hackers” alongside with North Korean, Chinese and Iranian hackers. At least, they believed so, and I assume that their subscribers believed too. I asked my boss if he ever heard anything about it and if we are working on that. He told me that we need to look at it, and since I asked a question about it, I was immediately appointed to investigate it.
Without going into investigation details, I found website of this “hacktivist” organization in the dark web. It took me couple days to connect dots, and so I was able to identify website owner. It brought me to 19-year old guy from Philippines. Typical picture: computer science student, pentester at “daytime”, “black hat hacker” at night time. He had his own blog, where under different nickname he posted information about hacks, SQL injections and website vandalism. It took me another day, before I was able to identify “anonymous” leader of their circle. It turned out to be a 16 year old teenager from Argentina. Believe it or not, high-school teenager, who spent most of his time by posting Pepe memes, was that “mysterious hacker” from Russia/North Korea/China/Iran.
Now, the story gets even more interesting. Do you think that they attacked those governments for some specific specific political or financial reason? No, that “hacktivist” group, which included 6 people, was just a bunch of conspiracy theorists and teenagers, who believed in very wild conspiracy theories such as “Committee of 300″ and other nonsense theories from Alex Jones and David Icke.
Yes, they sincerely believed that world is controlled by “New World Order” government which consisted of shape-shifted alien race. If you think that I am joking about their beliefs - check this Reptilians - Wikipedia, about 3% of US registered voters believe in that
Now, you might think: how the hell on the Earth these teens did it?
The answer is simple - maybe if people would stop using passwords like “admin12345” or “qwerty9876” on databases that contain confidential information, and click on “You won $100 Gift Card from Amazon - click on this link to receive it now” emails, then 16 year old boys from Argentina wouldn’t be able to hack them.
They believed that attacks on governmental databases will expose “reptilians” in the government, and will cause havoc in New World Order.
Yes, this happens too.

Rachael Willet",Vladislav Antonov,What’s the most memorable (scary/amazing/horrifying) thing you’ve seen on the dark web?,Deep Web
1,"No. Just… No.
Even if you could set up a site, kidnap someone, torture them in front of a camera and then kill them, you couldn’t stream it over TOR. Wanna know why?
Because TOR is a slow browser. It uses a lot of protection, making it extremly slow. Any site telling you it does that is a fake, so don’t buy it. Red rooms as red rooms don’t exist. The only way they “kinda” exist is by downloading a streaming program from their website, but this can be extremly dangerous. So do not, I repeat, DO NOT download those programs. In fact, don’t download anything from the dark web. You are going to have a bad time
EDIT: People were correcting me that TOR is actually fast enough. Thank you everybody. But I stick to my point. Red rooms aren’t real

2,"Yes, briefly. It’s pretty boring.
I downloaded an Onion browser with a VPN, and started exploring. There’s a website called the ‘darkwebwiki’ (or something) that indexes the best known .onion sites. After the great FBI purge of 2013, most of them were shut down. I was only able to access about 35% of the sites I tried to visit— which I found strange, since the sites that I tried to visit didn’t seem legally shady.
I continued exploring, and saw a hitman site called BesaMafia on the wiki’s homepage. This is actually quite famous, due to the debate over its legitimacy.
Here’s a screenshot that I found of it:
The site mostly deals with how you can hire a hitman with bitcoin. It has a few major rules— no politicians or children, etc… The site also included a page of testimonials from previous ‘customers’. Generally, this is when I would consider any site to be fake. They’re mostly the same:
“omg actually works— no spam— no surveys. give credit card # 2 continue ;D”.
BesaMafia’s testimonials were somewhat more believable. However, I found it strange that somewhat who had just hired a hitman would be unconcerned with writing a five star review that might well implicate them. I still don’t know whether I believe that it is genuine or a hoax to relieve you of your bitcoins.
The site got hacked about a year ago, and a lot of journalists went on and wrote articles about it. It went viral.
If you’d like to visit the site, don’t be concerned about breaking the law (You’re not). Besides, Onion browsers are encrypted, so you won’t get put on any lists.
After that site, I decided that I’d seen enough of the Dark Web.

4,"Facebook unveiled a second URL for their site that can only be accessed through TOR, which is a software that allows users to log-in anonymously from nearly anywhere on the planet-even in countries where Facebook is heavily monitored or blocked.
This makes Facebook the first major web company to offer a platform to a dark web. Why did Facebook Join dark web? First off, it's important to understand that the internet is vast and constantly growing, and the majority of our daily usage only scratched the surface, Google, Yahoo and other search engines only shows about 4% of the data available on the internet.
To access other 96% requires customized digging through individual sites, sub pages, restricted access journals or archives, and so on. This 96% is called ""dark web"". It's important to understand that pretty much everything we do online is visible, traceable, possibly being monitored.
Everything except... for the area of the deep web that are masked by the ""Dark Web"". The ""Dark web"" is concealed through a series of identity masking layers, which basically means that you can access and interact with it anonymously without being tracked. This is achieved through special encryption software like TOR, an acronym for The Onion Router, which when installed on your computer, appear and act like your standard FireFox browser, albeit slower.
But instead of Routing your connection through direct line, TOR routes everything through a series of encrypted computers all over the world, bouncing around randomly before it reaches it host destination.
This makes the origin of the data and the people searching for it, unknowable so while you might actually be in New York, your search traffic can appear to be coming from random points all over the world, making your location essentially untraceable.
So why does Facebook, a company that is anything but anonymous or discreet, want this? Well they can claim that it's all part of a long term effort to achieve greater ""Accessibility and security"" for its users - which according to some critics, is pretty much just code for desire global domination, Facebook wants to be used by everyone, everywhere And pushing the site into the dark web opens Facebook up to users who might otherwise be unable to access it, or might worry about government surveillance or other security controls or threats.
Places like Iran or China, for Example, are known to restrict access to social sites, like Facebook. TOR won't shield users' Facebook profiles or activities -those will still be public - but it will keep their location and potentially their real identify hidden from the authorities.
Browsing Dark Web may or may not be Safe, If your country restrict you from accessing some sites and you use Dark web to access them, that’s illegal and you are not safe if you are breaking rules.

5,"Bazillions of times. Here's the cold, stinky truth:
The vast majority of the websites you come across are precisely what you would expect from bored, perpetually-adolescent men like me: dancing animated dildos.
Serious as a crutch.
Remember the internet from the late 90's, before the Counterstrike mod? Its exactly like that; slow as dirt and four entire colors. This is because of what the darknet is supposed to be: an unmoderated internet. What it ends up being, unfortunately, is exactly that.
Yes, you will find the following:
Cannibal pr0n
Child pr0n
Red rooms
Drugs and guns
Wholesale malarkey and tomfoolery
Omghaxx0rs
But the truth is, anyone can get on the Darknet with minimal effort. So what you find more often is:
Bored FBI agents
Boys trying to impress each other
4Chan dropouts that can't grasp even the simplest of scripts
Someone who just found out what Linux is
“Journalists” that think they stumbled onto “the big scoop”
I'm not saying the Darknet is lame; I'm just saying that I2P is better (and much harder to use). But if you are worried about getting #swatted for seeing fake Jessica *Chastain nudes, just go to craigslist; that, and Wikia, is LITERALLY what half the Darknet looks like, because most people on it aren't website-engineers. It gets so unoriginally bad that you can go to a drug-market and ACTUALLY tic the “This item is illegal/report this item”-button.
Again… darknet is cool, for what it is. But if you refuse to put a little synaptic elbow grease into learning what real internet security is, you deserve the animated dildo memes, because that's as far as you will really get.
*Jessica Alba updated for 2017
Disclaimer: don't go to kiddy-pr0n sites. Not only is it incredibly evil, most of it is FBI. When I used TOR, there was a box you could tic to disable all those sites/images. If that is still around, use it.
Disclaimer: there is no such thing as anonymity. You are only a cost/benefit analysis for time, money and manpower… if you buy a gun, they will come after you.
Disclaimer: You would be surprised by what a “terrorism”-charge can be constituted of these days; don't do dumb s**t.
Disclaimer: Whonix, Tails, Qubes… these words mean the exact same thing as “TOR browser bundle”: not as secure as you think. Don't think you can fool the NSA because you spent five minutes torrenting something you couldn't be bothered to verify or even read the front-page description of.

6,"Welcome to the Onionland, one of the most mysterious place in the internet (there are still some deeper levels - Dark Web and Mariana Web).
Level 1 - Your usual Facebook, Google, Youtube
Level 2 - Academic databases, Financial records - you need special privileges to access these stuffs.
Level 3 - You need Tor to access this level. Said to be the home of illegal drugs, child porn, stolen credit card numbers, human trafficking, weapons, exotic animals, Taboo sex, Illegal sex. Although a lot of the activity that Tor is used for is evil, it is also used as a safe-haven for victims of cyberstalking, political dissidents, and can help just about anyone regain digital independence for example Wikileaks, which reveal government’s unworthy policies and secret agendas.
Level 4 - Marianas web : This level is speculative; no one knows whether it exists. It is said to contain a repository of all of the humanity’s best-kept secrets, like - The location of Atlantis, Aliens are live among us etc.
I have used Tor a lot of times and have viewed a lot of “.onion” domains. Here are the list of some of them that may get you started :
Where Google Doesn’t Go - DuckDuckGo

Link - http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/

Your google for browsing the dark web. It gives you much more privacy as search activity isn’t logged by design. It gives decent results without tracking your activities, which leads to question - Are Google’s extensive surveillance techniques really necessary?
Your Bank - Blockchain for Bitcoins

Link - https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion/

You will need to spend a bit of money to enjoy the dark web at it’s peak (Beware all, it’s a dangerous place). This wallet helps you keep bitcoins anonymously and is quite secure (even has HTTPS certification)
The Geek World - Sci-Hub

Link - http://scihub22266oqcxt.onion/

This website is heaven for all the science lovers and underfunded scientific institutions, as it provides free access to millions of research paper. This is the place which truly aims for Knowledge For All.
The Wikipedia of Dark Web - Hidden Wiki

Link - http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wi...

This is the place to start if you are new to dark web. This website indexes a wide variety of websites and sources running on the dark web. A lot of them are spams and also illegal, so beware.
Yes Facebook is here - The real Facebook

Link - https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/

I really don’t know the reason behind the presence of facebook’s onion URL. It’s quite possible that facebook wants to be accessible to its users where it’s censored. (Beware! This could be a phising site. Hackers use phising sites which look like familiar websites. Once you login with your id, you do get directed to facebook, but at the back your login id and password is mailed to the hacker, making you and your account vulnerable.)
Our Own Mailing System - Tor Mail

Link - http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion

This is a secure email client used by a lot of people for asking questions, contacting others etc.
The Address Book - TorLinks

Link - http://torlinkbgs6aabns.onion

TorLinks is the other robust and usually accessible collection of .onion addresses.
Host Your Own onion Domain - Freedom Hosting

Link - http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion

It supports a large part of onion-net, and you can use it to host anything in dark web anonymously. But you can’t host stuffs that are illegal under American law.
Dark web is a good place full of information and people having different ideas. What is great about it is that it really gives a chance to websites that are banned due to their free thinking - Wikileaks.
But with great power comes great responsibility. Due to this freedom, dark web has become home of a lot of illegal activities - stuffs you can get easily, that can really lead to big troubles. We all know the story of Silkroad - the website that brought dark web to lime light. So beware and use it with caution!

Amelia LeCount Kurtz",Goldie Harmon,What's the sketchiest place you've been/thing you've seen on the Internet? (Including deep web)?,Deep Web
8,"Let’s start off with a thought experiment:
You walk into a store and steal a bar of chocolate. That’s illegal, isn’t it?
Let’s take a second example: You walk into a store, steal a bar of chocolate, but no one notices. Now that’s still illegal, but you aren’t punished for it, since no one knows you did something illegal.
The same is true with the dark web:
the dark web is the same as the normal internet, but there are mechanisms in place to obfuscate your real identity. If you do something illegal in the dark web, it’s like stealing the chocolate bar and not being caught (because of obfuscation of your real identity)
Your original question “Why can’t the law close down the dark web” is like asking “Why can’t the law solve murder?”
Doing something illegal on the dark web is already illegal even without making specific laws about the dark web (buying stolen goods online is the same as offline in the eyes of the law). It’s just that that never prevented anyone from practically doing something illegal in the first place.
Now you might ask: Why is identity obfuscation (and other techniques used in the deep web) allowed in the first place?
Let’s use the TOR network as an example:
Tor is a system developed to obfuscate your identity, location, actions, etc… developed by the US “Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency” (DARPA) in combination with Office of Naval Research and other US government sources.
The reason is that if you have (international) spies, diplomats, military officers, etc trying to transmit potentially highly secret and important informations, you want a system to make the origin and identity of those i.e. spies as hard to figure out as possible.
So you design a system that randomly bounces signals around between different computers to make it harder to follow a message.
Now you have a problem:
As soon as someone notices “Well, someone is accessing this obfuscation network from place xyz” the person you’re trying to hide from knows where you are and who you are (or at least your IP address).
The only way to solve this is to have as many users as possible, using it for as many different usecases as possible, so no one immidiatly suspects you’re using it to hide mission critical information.
To give a non-computer example:
Let’s say you are sitting in a room with 10 people.
You choose on person.
This person has the task to exchange some information with another person, without revealing the information or the person he’s talking to (if you knew the person you could shake him down for the information or kill the informant)
If 8 of the people in the room talk english, but the person you picked and one other person speak in a different language, you knew who was the informant.
However if all people talk in a different language, you not only have no idea what the information is, but also who is being informed.
For anyone being able to hide anything it’s important to blend into a crowd, so systems that make TOR and any other obfuscation mechanism (even simple ones like VPNs) work have to be available to pretty much everyone.
The downside is of course that illegal information can also be passed around, but the upsides of hiding the identity of informants, journalists, government agents and there like outweighs the negatives.

This is really dark. Skip if you have emotional issues.

10,"Note: To people who think that I’m a “sicko” who paid to watch this sort of thing, I didn’t. I read enough about Tor and explored it to the extent where I could tell which things were scams. I’m a curious person who wants to debunk myths about the dark web.
I would like to edit my answer to this question, because when I originally wrote it, I had much less experience on the dark web.
No, they don’t exist, or at least not in the way that the horror stories make them out to be. There are a lot of sites that refer to themselves as “red rooms,” but they are bitcoin scams. For example, the one below:
There are multiple sites like that one I’ve seen, and I think they may even all be run by the same person.
When I wrote my original answer, I had come across quite a few of these scams, and assumed they were real, which was naive. It’s near-impossible to stream live video over the Tor network (or even other anonymity networks like I2P and Freenet). So, that would render a service like a red room (i.e. a site that streams live torture and murder) impossible, and certainly not profitable.
The sites that say they’re red rooms will take your bitcoin, and you’ll never see it again - I can promise this.
There are some sites that show non-live videos that are quite gruesome, but I don’t think this counts as a red room.
A lot of people use the case of Peter Scully and his crimes as evidence for red rooms, but as Rachel Barnes said below, Scully’s videos weren’t live (as horrible as they may have been).
Scully was a member of a Tor site called Hurt 2 The Core, which was a so-called “hurtcore” site. Apparently, the site had a hidden section for the most active members, in which they could upload their own content. The reason I know this is not from seeing the site itself, but from reading articles about it; I figured out the rest.
These kinds of cases have contributed to the idea of red rooms, for certain, but they don’t quite fit the definition.

*Warning: Mentions of CP (child porn)*
I think this happened like last month?
I used to unironically play Roblox back in 2012–2015, I still occasionally check up on the fourms and everything and check on the groups I was in. I’m currently in a Discord server with a couple of people from my old Roblox group and were all basically best friends.
So one day my friend is like “Some shit is happening in the fourms, someone said ‘I was on the dark web and I found a CP website’ and gave a link”. I immediately didn’t believe it. There was no way someome had been able to put a non-YouTube link on Roblox without it being censored… so I took it on myself to investigate.
I always thought that things like CP websites, red rooms, or like websites that do illegals things would require some like formal invite to even know of them, like super complex code or encryption would have to be done in order to get to it… apparently thats not true.
I initally thought that it was just a IP jacker link and he/she was causing a stir for like IP addresses.
My friend had posted a link to the post and she said something like; “Im too scared to do it myself…”
I click the link she gave me, I go to the post, and I put the link on the post on the address bar.
*Boy was that a bad idea.*
The website loads and I just see HUNDREDS of photos of little kids in all sorts of disgusting acts. I’m not even going to describe what I saw; it makes me sick that people would take advantage of children like the way I saw…
Reacting, I immediately clicked off the website and close my laptop. I was shocked, I had no idea that it was actually gonna show up. Though in hindsight I did see all the comments from the people on the post that said “Don’t click it”…
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE!!
I don’t purposely go on a hunt for these types of things…
I go on my Discord server and spam “ITS REAL, I WAS WRONG. DONT CLICK. DON’T CLICK IT.”
I didn’t use the internet for about a week…
The moral of the story is: Don’t click on anything that has “CP” in the title or you are gonna have a really bad time.

12,"As my fellow dark web explorer Brandon Rivera said above, “…it is extremely improbable that red rooms [do] exist on the dark web.” He’s right.
Supposedly, red rooms are sites where you can view videos of torture and murder on the dark web, and also participate in them via a chat room. As Mr. Rivera also said, of course, Tor’s speed (because of the onion routing method it uses for anonymity), makes it difficult to do such a thing.
I have watched videos on certain Tor sites (legal ones, mind you), and they loaded quite slowly. It’s possible to stream video over Tor, but you would have to enable Flash, which would also compromise your anonymity. If you were doing something like…oh, watching a live murder, I wouldn’t think you would want to give away your identity!
I know I’ve shared screenshots like the one above on previous answers, and trust me, I’m almost certain that these sites are scams. Even without having paid for them, I read the descriptions, and they sounded like, to use the technical term, bullshit.
Having said all this, if you still want to “find” one of these sites on the dark web, or more specifically, Tor, it isn’t that difficult. Use one of the search engines, like not Evil or Ahmia, and type in “red room.” A lot of sites like the one above will come up in search results. Of course, I have a feeling that they aren’t the real thing, but you can pay for them if you like - and risk losing a lot of money (or possibly even getting arrested)!
That being said, on my previous answer regarding this subject, I mentioned that there are some sites that look very vague, and were a bit more difficult to find. There’s a remote possibility that these are, if not red rooms, something criminal that isn’t open to the public.
I have no idea what these sites actually are - it’s possible that they’re just forums conducting illegal activity that want to keep out law enforcement and non-members.
There is a site I found early on in my Tor journey called “Suicide Apartment,” which is apparently a site for people who want to commit suicide together, but not necessarily on video. It’s a members-only site that requires a voucher to get in:
Don’t believe me? Just type in the onion address in the screenshot there. It’s sites like this that have partly kept the red room urban legend alive, I think.
As to how you get a membership to these sites, I have no idea. It’s probably a word-of-mouth kind of thing. Hey…can I get a pass to your red room?

13,"Ok so first thing you need to know is that nowadays it’s kind of risky compared to some time ago. In my case, I used to surf into the ‘deep/dark web’ or whatever bullshit people calls it. Why? Because as a ‘hacker’ philosophy in the way that hacker means to know something of everything, I was always eager of knowledge, I wanted to literally know it all.
So one day I read about it, and I really felt anxious of what could happen and if the police would come for me. To clear a bit the things, I’m from Mexico, and 4 years ago when this happened, there were almost no real internet laws that you could fear, and I was living temporaly in a friend’s apartment… my thinking was “if the police ever comes, I can blame my partner” (evil laughing). So the next day after setting up some additional proxies to the ones Tor provided, getting ready to unplug my pc cable at anytime and a notebook to grab some notes, I ran the Tor program. I was literally sweating hard time. For me it was like stealing or killing, all because of the internet stuff that made you ask this question; however, the things went completely different.
At first I got redirected to a kind of listing, where the information was gathered by categories, and in each one there were some (not descriptive) links. The ones that I can remember went from common searches like ‘porn, fetishes, exotic animal selling, markets’ up to some other that had funny and really strange names. Of course I knew there was child pornography, which I found really disgusting and I’m happy that many of the consumers were arrested, so I didn’t even bother to enter the porn links, I knew that I could see some disgusting things that a friend told me (but couldn’t prove if he was saying the truth) about those links. So instead I decided to go to the gore ones. In that moment I thought “I’ve seen lots of gore and disgusting movies, even ‘snuff’ ones, what could possibly go wrong”… it all went wrong. I think that this is the 60~70% of the deep/dark web is all about. Getting morbid and unhealthy stuff.
In resume, these links provided videos, explicit images, descriptions and even sites like this but related to some morbid and unhealthy things that sick people asks. But it wasn’t all about humans, there were animals, accidents, murders, suicides… and as you can imagine, fetishes around these topics. So after and hour or so of surfing I decided that it was enough for that day, I was so disgusted that I even forgot the Tor tutorial which suggested to change the IP every 10 minutes, so I started to freak out. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t talk to anyone of what I saw… I mean, someone could tell the police, right?
So the next day and through the next month, I obviously surfed it again. But after the first wrong experience, I decided to go deeper and find that ‘magic’ stuff that everyone talked about. And I indeed found it. Some of the things I remember were:
The Internet manifesto - Random stuff written by sick people.
The book of the anarchy - A book to hack some things (real things), like television, public phones, creating bombs, other dangerous stuff like acids, how to explode your cat, etc.
Drug recipes - This was very interesting because I found almost every drug recipe, and it was like a science book, with the chemistry image and step by step.
Snuff videos - This were very creepy, as almost all of them showed how slowly someone kills another. I don’t know if it’s the way this sick genre of movies is, but most of them were like in stages, for example in stage one, someone is slapping a (¿kidnapped?) girl that is obviously tied like hundred of times, the next one, the same girl is also tied but with headphones on and the music is so loud that she screams… that kind of stuff. And there are plenty of them.
Illegal markets - They sold almost everything. I remembered seeing one article of organs selling, and you could choose among a list; there were also drugs, weapons (all types), some latin books, paintings (¿stolen?), hookers, some strange food, etc.
Hiring killers - I found some of them in the markets, but there were spread some ads and were obfuscated in the way that the ‘killer’ part was dissimulated. There were some terms like ‘mechanics’ or ‘repairing’, ‘disappearing’, ‘help with unwanted people’ that were use instead.
UFO stuff - This was clearly the best part, but also there was little information about it. I read some old articles about Area 51, landings, pictures, videos. But in my humble opinion, they were all fake.
Paranormal stuff - Creepy as fuck. There were mostly images (I don’t know if they were edited) that really pulled me out of my chair. Especially a link that took me to a full image webpage, there was nothing in it except that the image was from a sunny day and a house devastated by USA bombing in Irak, but after 5 seconds, a ghost walked from a far door straight to the front of the monitor, as it size was increasing, it all went so fast that I fell of my chair… it was funny, but my PC was screaming and the image was shaking, as I would expect, I couldn’t close the damn window so I restarted the PC.
Forbidden books - This was very interesting because there were some books that they were said to be prohibited by the Vatican and shit, I wasn’t interested in those, but I could recall some ‘book of the death’ and things like that. The real mindblown came with some books that said how the history really went, and how it was manipulated, in resume, conspiracy ones.
Hacking - As I didn’t had a camera in that time, I wasn’t afraid of this thing, but here were some easily access tutorials on how to hack wifi networks, PCs, leaked databases, and some other stuff. I got shocked when I saw a notebook window open and someone typing on it, my mouse wasn’t responding and someone was using it. I was going to shut down my PC when I discovered that it was a bad joke and all of the elements were part of the website, same stuff like the paranormal ones.
Webcams - Webcams of EVERYTHING. I remember one specially of a dead body in an apartment, it was really creepy. But you could also search webcams by IP and see traffic, people, animals, offices, homes. Maybe these ones are those that people are afraid of.
That was my journey through the deep/dark web. To cut things off, I wouldn’t recommend to go in there because of 3 main reasons: 1) Unless you want to see disgusting things 2) Most of the sites were closed 3) It wasn’t never secure, but nowadays I’ve heard its more dangerous as of police and hackers. All of this information is the one I found 4 years ago, so maybe everything has changed… I hope.

14,"I think you mean the “dark web.”
The deep Web is just any page that you can't get to from a search engine. Your bank account page is the deep Web. It was created by your bank. Your Facebook “edit profile” page is the deep Web. It was created by Facebook.
If you mean the dark Web, which is a Web that uses special software such as TOR to access, it depends on which dark Web you mean. There are three big ones (TOR, Freenet, and I2P) and countless small ones.
TOR, the largest darknet, was developed by three scientists, Paul Syversin, Mike Reed, and David Goldshlag. It was originally designed and implemented by the United States Defense Advance Research Projects Agency. Later, its continued growth was financed by the State Department, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the Naval Research Lab. The US government first used TOR to protect US military communications, and today sees it as a way to get information into and out of repressive totalitarian countries that attempt to control Internet access.
I2P started as a project at Leiden University, supported financially by a grant from Duck Duck Go, the anonymous search engine. It was originally based on the Freenet code, but split off into its own project and codebase. Today, development and maintenance is handled by a private company called Privacy Solutions.
Freenet was started by Ian Clarke, a graduate student at the University of Eidenburgh. Today, it is maintained by The Freenet Project, a group of thirteen developers financed mostly through private donations, with help from a large number of volunteer coders.
Unlike the lurid media stories and superstitious fear prompted by horror movies like The Red Room, the actual dark Web is not a place of fear and terror run by murderers and criminal gangs.

16,"Many people seem to have confused the Deep web with the Dark web, but fail to understand how different they are. I will try to explain them as best as I can.
The Deep Web
Technically and practically the Deep web is information* that can not be accessed from search engines. But let me explain with more detail. To understand what that means we first need to analyze what search engines are, how they work and why some data cannot be accessed by them. Search Engines are online services that allow you to search for websites, images and other files inside their database. Some great examples of search engines are Google, Bing, Yahoo! or DuckDuckGo. Search engines use programs called web crawlers (mostly known as spiders or robots). A web crawler is a program that scans a page you give for links. Once it finds the links it opens them and scan the pages they lead to as well. During the whole process they store every page in their database, which you search through when you use a search engine.
*Information - meaning web pages, files, videos, pics and more
In case you have not realized there is a problem about this technique, and the problem is that there are some web pages that are not linked to others. Therefore they cannot be found from web crawlers. Which means they are inaccessible from search engines. These pages are the deep web. However, it is in no way that simple, since the deep web, unlike the surface web, does only consist of pages and files, but databases as well. These databases are virtual places, in a way, where every piece of information of the internet is stored in. That obviously includes, but is not limited to, passwords, access keys, secret information and more. Almost every dynamic (web 2.0 +) site has a database and that database is usually a lot larger than the pages of the website (that’s why the deep web is considered enormous). These databases cannot be accessed from the search engines either, so they are considered a part of the deep web. The deep web also includes private documents, pages and files and password protected pages. Which means that your Facebook profile, the way you see it while logged in your account, is a Deep Web page!
Database servers
Now let’s move on to a creepy side of this topic..
The Dark Web
The Dark Web consists of Networks and can only be accessed with special software (depending on the network you want to connect to, typically TOR network - using the TOR proxy and browser) and specifically configured network settings, so you properly and anonymously connect to the Network. Information hosted on these Networks can also not be accessed from search engines which technically means it’s part of the deep web, but contrary to popular belief, it’s not literally “inside” of it. Everything on TOR network (By far the biggest dark web Network) is encrypted and hidden in order to ensure your private information remains private. This allows you to stay anonymous and share things that you would normally never do. Nothing can ever be traced back to you, even the FBI and other top agencies will struggle to find you. This is taken advantage of by many criminals, using those Networks to promote and provide their illegal services. Many pedophiles, drug dealers, human traffickers and crime organizations are known to host websites on the Dark web.
Some popular and rather disturbing sites on the Dark web (these are .onion sites, meaning they are inside the TOR network)
I have found a lot more sites that I literally cannot display because it is illegal.
Technically the Deep Web is harder to access to than the Dark web because it requires hacking skills to leak databases and more, while the dark web only requires special software which can easily be installed on your computer.
Many people suggest shutting down networks like TOR but will this make any difference? What they fail to understand is 1. Crime has existed before TOR and 2. TOR is very useful, that’s why it still exists. It allows for Journalists to do research anonymously, it helps people access the web from countries where it is banned and more.

17,"Accessing the so-called “dark web” isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be, and the main things that make it unsafe are doing foolish things (like trusting random strangers).
I should point out that the “dark web” isn’t just one large thing, but is composed of many separate networks, known as “darknets.” As Wikipedia defines it:
A darknet (or dark net) is a portion of routed, allocated IP space not running any services. Traffic arriving to such IP dark space is undesired since it has no active hosts.
One of the types of software that people think of as the dark web is Tor, which can be downloaded from Download Tor. Run the software, and congratulations - you’re on the dark web!
More specifically, the Tor Browser can access both the “clearnet” (the internet you use every day), and Tor hidden services (sites built on top of the Tor network). Tor hidden services are also known as “.onion sites.”
As to how to do it safely, it’s best to not modify the Tor Browser in any way, if at all possible, unless you know what you’re doing. For example, don’t add browser extensions, like Google Translate. The reason for this is that any modifications made to the browser can break your anonymity.
Also, as I’m fond of saying, “Anything that looks too good to be true definitely is.” I’ve met many scammers and sketchy folks during my time on Tor, and so I tend not to trust people who make outlandish promises. For example, “Download this software and you can double your bitcoin!” Or, “Buy these discounted Amazon gift cards!”
Now…as for “amazing facts,” I don’t know. I think that idea is massively over-hyped. I have found some interesting hacking-related forums and such, and have learned a few tips about coding. Plus, there are a number of whistleblowing sites (think Wikileaks).
Beyond that, if you’re looking to get into something criminal (like carding or narcotics), it’s a great place for that, although people don’t hold your hand. There’s a lot of paranoia and distrust, because you don’t know who’s going to screw you over, or who’s a cop.
So, those are a few examples. Still interested?

21,"Without giving the gory details, I will tell you. Skip the next paragraph to find out.
But first, I want to say, I was very curious about the dark web about 2 years ago. I found out how to access it. I downloaded a TOR client on my smartphone, and spent like 30 minutes trying to figure out how to surf it and not get bombarded with ads and such. The dark web is really hard to navigate. There’s no “google” for it. If the dark site can be found with a dark search engine, then it isn’t that bad. Just a bunch of illegal stuff. Everything costs money though. Anything worth hiding on the dark web, is worth a few bucks of crypto currency apparently. Well, I hadn’t had any bitcoins for a few years. (I had pulled out) So the only thing available was text. So what rabbit hole did I fall into you may ask? …
I completely read a human cookbook. It was well written, no spelling or grammar mistakes, and no fluff. It was matter-of-fact. It had everything, from how to stalk your victims, to which age/gender tasted better, to text-based butcher portions, to how to gather and cook the blood, how to host a human steak party, to the more cruel way of keeping your meal, I mean, victim, alive and fresh, while you ate a limb a week.
It was way more gross than I am willing to write here. I was both disgusted and intrigued. I couldn’t sleep that night. And for the next few weeks, I couldn’t look at any strangers in public for more than 2 seconds before the words came flushing back into my memory. My brain told me “she would be a perfect candidate for a meal” or “why is she walking alone in this area? Doesn’t she know she’s the perfect age for human steaks?”

The fringes of web society are intriguing in some respects, but increasingly poor choices of how and where to spend time online.  A bit like exploring the back alleys of a major city, they can be exciting and expand your understanding of the world if you live in the suburbs, but you're at risk - not only from the authorities but from the criminals who inhabit those places.  You're also ethically in a very grey area... for example, everyone who visits Amsterdam wants to see the famous red light district or visit a 'coffee shop' - but these tourist attractions are the tip of an iceberg that includes horrendous exploitation, victims of poverty and crime.  It's a fun, harmless night out for a tourist on the surface - but it's also a violent world of organised crime and human rights abuses underneath.

When I was a cash-strapped postgrad web developer in the mid 90s, everyone used to seek out Warez sites for cracked copies of Photoshop, hit FTP sites and bulletin boards for free stuff and use NNTP newsgroups to find pictures of nude celebrities (in my first office, we had a competition to find ALL the characters from Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 nude on NNTP, for example).  It was just a bit of fun right?  Everyone did it.

Inevitably, we found viruses, malware, phishing scams, FBI stings, race-hate organisations, pedophiles, organised crime... the full gamut of people you don't want capturing your IP address or getting your email.  Flame wars erupted as one guy I worked with started mail-bombing white supremecists, people got their machines corrupted, people passed on the details of child porn posters to the authorities then had to explain why THEY were using alt.binaries.nude.teens groups themselves.  I started playing the fool, baiting some Nigerian bank account 419 scammers who somehow got my mobile phone number and kept calling me up asking me to meet them to exchange money etc. That wasn't funny.

I was involved in setting up a company that tracks illegal music downloads called Semetric.  They can see everything.  I also helped set-up the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (a UK police operation) who can see everything too.  What I've learned is that within music torrent sites, not only are record labels tracking and prosecuting for copyright breach, the police are monitoring a trade in images of child abuse, covert terror suspect communication & DOS attacks... there's very little going on that doesn't have a digital footprint.   Just being there doesn't make you guilty of anything, but click the wrong link or download a DVD from someone who is into criminal activity and sooner or later, it could cause you serious problems even if you're 'innocently' getting an album or movie to watch. 

My advice is to be mindful of the broader social context of what you're doing on the fringes of the digital world.  In all honesty, the size and scale of these networks means most people can get free software, music, movies or whatever without ever suffering any negative consequences... yet, but every now and again someone gets sued for their pirate MP3s, or gets their Facebook hacked, or has to wipe their entire machine over a worm, or gets their credit card jacked, or winds-up on a watch list for suspected criminal behaviour without even knowing. 

In the same way we all know someone who tried to score some weed off a dodgy guy at a rock gig once and wound up getting beaten-up and mugged, exploring the digital underworld is risky and ethically questionable - even more so now that we're much more aware of the activities that characterise those places than the naive wild-west days of the mid 90s... before the world wide web and social networks become the dominant public places they are today.  If you can't explain why you were there, the authorities will assume the worst too, meaning an innocent walk on the wild side can lead to very serious consequences.  Remember, the notion of telling the police ""I was there looking for a pirate copy of the new James Bond movie"" or ""I was researching hacker groups"" or whatever won't make them inclined to help you if your identity gets stolen by a Russian crime syndicate or your PC ends-up with pictures in your browser cache of underage kids in the nude.

24,"It's fairly simple, really (although you may not always find what you're looking for).  This is the link for Grams (http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/ ). 
DISCLAIMER: This answer is for informational purposes only.  I'm fully aware that purchasing narcotics online is a felony, and also involves a high amount of risk.  There is always the chance that you will get caught, that the drugs may be impure, or that someone will steal your money and/or identity.  See DEA Office of Diversion Control for more details.
Grams - Google's Evil Twin: Just to be clear, Grams really has nothing to do with Google (other than their logo looking similar).  In fact, I would think that Google might want to distance themselves from it as much as possible.  Grams is designed to search for darknet markets, in particular ones that sell drugs (hence the name), although some other products are included as well.
See the picture above?  In theory, what you would do is think of whatever drug (or other product) you might be searching for, and type it into the search bar.  For example, let's say you type in ""marijuana,"" or ""weed.""  That part is easy.
When the results come up, it lists various darknet markets that carry marijuana, usually including the price (in bitcoin).  In fact, it normally doesn't just say ""marijuana""; it would list dozens of different types of marijuana.  So if there's a specific type that you like, you would have to type that in.  For example, if you like hydro, you would have to type in ""hydro.""  That comes up with 616 results.  The first result to come up when you type that in (currently) is ""Critical Mass 1g Hydro AAA,"" from the Valhalla Market (a.k.a. Silkkitie).  The price is listed below it, which is ""฿0.03049281.""
Screenshot Credit: DeepDotWeb - Surfacing The News From The Deep Web
In order to purchase that particular marijuana, then, you would have to register for the Valhalla market, which is invite-only (I believe this is to deter undercover law enforcement agents).  So, they'll redirect you to their forum in order to try and get an invite from someone.  If you're genuinely there as a buyer, and not to infiltrate them, this process is fairly easy. 
Just be careful about revealing your real identity (this goes for the darknet in general!).
Be Fake.  Really.
If you decide to register for any darknet market, I would suggest using a screen name that you don't use anywhere on the surface web.  What I sometimes do on the deep web is create a screen name using Soybomb nonsense word generator .  For example, here's one list of words it generated:
Roll the Dice
As far as passwords go, I try to create a password (or passphrase) that I haven't used on any other website.  I've begun using the ""diceware"" method of creating passwords ever since I started exploring the dark web, which essentially generates random words and numbers for your passphrase. 
An example of a randomly generated diceware passphrase is ""wahoo.jack.hide.whinny.honk.blip."" (Note - I have not used this as a password anywhere!)  See Why diceware passphrase are more stronger than our own passphrase with real word?
This may sound overly complicated, but think of it as a security method!  
16?  That's Twice the Bits!
Speaking of which, you generally need bitcoin to purchase all of these things, which is a whole different answer in and of itself.  If you don't have a bitcoin wallet, you'll have to set that up separately. 
I don't remember how many different markets are included in the Grams search, but some of them include Agora, 1776, The Andromeda Market, Black Bank, Bungee54, and The Pirate Market.  This will likely increase over time.
You can also filter out specific darknet markets if you don't want to include those.  The current version of Grams also links to Helix, Helix Light, and GramsFlow.  The first two are bitcoin cleaners, which help obscure the source of the transactions.
GramsFlow helps you to get to various .onion sites on Tor, without having to remember their long and complicated URL addresses.
With a little practice, I'm sure using Grams will get easier (as with any technology).

I visit the deep web quite regularly — I’m interested in what brings people in there, I chat with them a little bit (anonymously, of course), and usually don’t dig very deep since I’m pretty comfortable sticking with LEGAL material only.
But once, out of curiosity, while reading random threads on one of local social networks, I found that creepy link, promising the visitors some pretty disturbing material. Obviously it wouldn’t be me if I hadn’t clicked on it.
But what I found there was way more disturbing than I could’ve possibly imagined. In just a couple of minutes, I saw everything — slow and painful animal torture, child abuse (“fortunately” at least not sexual), lots of blood and body parts, murdered hookers, brutal street brawls, footage of the IS, more blood and body parts, videos of public shootouts usually ending up horribly, and a LOT more. (It’s interesting that most of the material apparently came from eastern-asian areas such as Philippines or Indonesia. Does anybody know why?)
I am relatively okay with looking at people killing people (though it’s not my favorite activity anyway), nor do I have problems with blood streaming out of the human body. The thing that really made me close the tab and shake of disgust and hopelessness was the torture of innocent children and animals.
The people out there, in the deep depth of the deep web, are damn ill and need to seek help. I’ve been happy to return to the legal material ever since.
P.S.:
As it might sound desperate, I feel obliged to mention a person who represents the opposite side of the deep web. She has not yet turned 18, but she already does everything she can to report pedophiles and child abusers in the corners of darknet, to the FBI. She herself is a victim of an abusive step-father, and once will hopefully become a member of the federal anti cyber-attack team. She, along with many others volunteering daily against illegal activity on the darknet, is a real proof that true heros do exist.

There is a whole video about people who screwed up on the dark web and got caught doing some naughty stuff. From selling drugs to big ass waves of cp. And from this we get the first point.
By doing illegal shit. Be it selling, buying, or trading drugs and cp, FBI will always get a way to catch you by using what's called a correlation attack. And they'll look for any way you screwed up by mentioning what you were doing accidentally on the clear net.
Now, the first rule of dark web is, if you don't want to see it, don't look it up. Those disturbing videos you see on YouTube and liveleak that claim to be from the dark web? They may or may not be from there. But don't be surprised to find something similar if you look that stuff up on the dark web. This gets us to the next point.
By visiting bait sites. Sites that'll claim to do something for you, when in fact, what it'll be doing is giving some fellow hackers an easy way inside your computer. And then suddenly you're all sorrounded with blackmail.
The whole point up there brings my next point.
By not being responsible for what they're doing aka lacking common sense and logic. Sites may require a “small donation” to let you into some websites. Well, that'd be a nice time to kiss your money goodbye. Because you're not gonna get anything in return. Except Maybe a visit from the local police if you're still doing illegal shit.
The point simply is, be a good boy. Use tor for anonymity. not for hiring hackers and hitmen or selling/buying drugs and cp. The dark web community is overall nice. If you remain within the innocent stuff border. You cross that border, you screw up.

people.
I have made contacts over the years on 100’s of boards & forums about all kinds of things.
MANY admin tools can be used for hacking, there are many tools the default settings on some AV scanners block/disable as a security risk.
People share their info, just like on here, people ask questions, ask for help, people share their info & tips, some times that’s legal info, sometimes not, on the dark web different boards still have their own rules, they just are more relaxed than the rules here.
Do not misunderstand, one board I’m on about hardware would ban you if you posted “sex for sale” even if it was legal such as in Amsterdam. but legally grey talks about hardware (or down right illegal on topic, within the board rules) will be fine & accepted.
sure I picked up some “tricks” that I would need my manager to sign off on BEFORE I done them but the people, knowing who I can trust, (rather than the “delete system32” trolls) those are the biggest resource of the web, normal or dark. & I have no doubt some of the people I interact with have less than legal experience or use information I MAY have helped with for illegal proposes.

31,"They say there is no such thing like a stupid question…
With that in mind, I observe that you want to get started with AI/ML. Maybe you should start here: let’s see how the things you ask about are connected to each other:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a base field dealing with machine intelligence, not necessary machine learning.
Machine Learning is a subset of AI dealing with allowing machines to learn (and ultimately “reason”) without being explicitly programmed. It starts with the belief that if you have lots of data (labeled or not), and an optimization method based on minimizing a cost/loss function you can enable an algorithm to learn (creating so called “models”) and then apply the learning to new data (predict/inference), mostly to be able to do stuff like label/classify, score, (de)compress, associate, cluster, analyze, create, etc.
Neural Networks is a subset of Machine Learning, it deals with achieving the task of Machine Learning by using the concepts like activation functions (typically neurons or more complex units like gru, lstm) connected through a “graph”, a method of adjusting the coefficients (usually back-propagation) and a method of optimization (usually some form of adaptative stochastic gradient descent, with momentum). A Neural Network typically consists of an input layer, an output layer and hidden layers (zero, one, or many)
Deep Learning is a subset of Neural Networks where you have typically more than one hidden layers. The main thing about Deep Learning is that it can achieve very good results where there is an abundance of (typically labeled) data.
Convolutional Nets is a subset of Deep Learning that has been successful for computer vision tasks. It allows you to look at a set of adjacent pixels + channels together and threat them as input information in order to perform tasks like detecting and recognizing classes of objects or making sense of image data.
The deep web however is not connected with the above terms… it has nothing to do with AI/ML at all.
Now, in order to give you a response to your question: learn the basics of Machine Learning because you need to understand first how to deal with data, how to evaluate models, types of algorithms, etc. Then move on to Neural Networks, particularly to Deep Learning (but not necessary Convolutional Nets, that may be too narrow as it is only successful in computer vision tasks and is now quite overcrowded). Explore all of Deep Learning first including Feed Forward Nets (FFNN), Reinforcement Learing (RL), Recurrent Nets (RNN), Convolutional Nets (CNN), Autoencoders (AE), etc. Start with real or generated data but try to apply everything you learn to something in order to make sure you understand which algorithm works best.
Three other things in particular are very important and you need real data and real objectives in order to dive deep into it: 1. data engineering, and particularly feature engineering, 2. hyper-parameter tuning, and 3. a standard evaluation/cross-validation… because you’ll get into overfitting and underfitting very fast, and you have to understand when it happens, why it happens and how to deal with it.
If you want to start with an online course(s), take the deeplearning.ai set of courses just launched by professor Andrew Ng. It covers everything above from the basics of ML up to Deep Learning and beyond.
I hope this helps. Good luck!

32,"Originally Answered: Why can't the US government make the dark web illegal and ban it?
A lot of people who use the so-called “dark web” aren’t criminals, contrary to popular belief (I’m one of them, in fact). What people commonly refer to as the dark web is actually a number of different anonymity networks, like Tor, I2P, Freenet, GNUnet, and ZeroNet. (This is an older version of the Tor Browser below.)
Unfortunately, things like the exaggerated YouTube horror stories, as well as tabloid headlines, tend to blow the dark web out of proportion. Personally, I don’t want it to be made illegal - it helps the average citizen have privacy and anonymity, and it’s also used by law enforcement and the military.
Also, according to statistics, the majority of people who use Tor don’t even visit the so-called “dark web.” Tor is also designed to use the “clearnet” (the non-encrypted internet) anonymously. For example, you could visit a site like Quora, Twitter, Google, or Pinterest without being identified by your real IP address. The sites would look about the same when accessed through Tor, although because of a browser plugin called NoScript, sometimes certain functions on different sites would be disabled.
Its bad reputation comes from the fact that there are things like darknet markets (sites hosted on the network that sell illegal items, like drugs and fraud-related things), or carding forums. However, law enforcement agencies across the world are investigating these markets (lest you think they’re just operating with impunity). Two major markets were shut down not long ago - AlphaBay and Hansa Market:
These aren’t the only kinds of sites, though - they’re just the type that make good news headlines. Plus, if you’re getting your information from things like YouTube horror stories, let me assure you - most, if not all, of those stories are fictitious!
Many of the sites that you probably haven’t heard of are just forums, social networks, and people’s personal sites (not unlike on the clearnet). The difference is that on Tor, people can use these kinds of sites anonymously. Not only are their IP addresses disguised, but people tend to use fake photos, fake names, and very little, if any, personal information. They like to interact, but as a fictitious identity (for lack of a better word).
Also, I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but similar criminal activity takes place on the clearnet:
Plus, there are phishing sites and all manner of scams on the clearnet as well. Does that mean we should ban the entire internet? I don’t think so.
Personally, I feel that the government has “banned” enough things, and I think there should be more things like Tor. Not to help criminals, but just to help people as individuals have privacy.

33,"Agencies of the Governments of both the United States and Germany have actually invested real money in developing and supporting Dark Web technologies.
US Department of State financed the Tor Dark Web project with 1.8 million dollars in 2013. The US Department of Defence spent $830,000 on funding SRI international to develop Dark Web technology also.
The point of the Dark Web is anonymity. It's specifically designed so that a thing that somebody posts (or downloads) on the dark web is accessible to the person, but that nobody (including law enforcement) can discover who that person is by simply tracing back an ip address to a location.
The dark web ensures that someone can access the internet without their access location, and by extension, their identiy being exposed, because the IP is being bounced around many servers, and the origin is impossible to find. This ensures privacy, at the expense of speed (bouncing your IP around hundreds of anonymizing servers makes your ping spread out into the hundreds of milliseconds timeframe).
The idea is that people in locations where the internet is monitored, censored heavily and there is risk of being arrested and/or sacked for providing essential informaiton to the United States Government (China, Russia, North Korea, Lockheed inc, Boeing, big government subcontractor) can access the internet Anonymously (so they don't get arrested by Kim Jong Un, or sacked by a corrupt business executive) to provide data.
This might be used for ensuring a journalist’s source is protected when breaking a story. Or some random employee of Boeing to provide evidence of wrongdoing at rinkydink airlines which might be a major safety concern, to the FAA (Whistleblowing) without jeopardising their family (so they don’t get a hit put out on them, or barred from the industry).
Activists in foreign countries can use the dark web to access websites that are usually available on the normal internet, but would be illegal to access in their host country. For example, it is illegal to access Google, Instagram, Soundcloud, Pintrest, The New York Times and Amnesty International in China Websites blocked in mainland China . And although it's easy enough to use a vpn to access it, it's also easy enough for the CCP (China Communist Party) to notice that access and expel said diplomat from the country… or just Jail them like Chinese dissident Qin Yongmin jailed after 'show trial'
The article ""A public policy perspective of the Dark Web"" https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23738871.2017.1298643 , specifies
‘There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously,’ and that ‘These uses for hidden services are new and have great potential’ (Ward 2014). Tor is a tool which can be used anonymously for both legal and criminal purposes. While it is essential to acknowledge the important role that anonymity plays in protecting human rights activists from oppressive regimes, it is also important to consider the challenges that anonymity poses to the law enforcement community.
I don’t see “Protecting human rights” as “Useless” although it can easily be argued that, in some countries, such as China, North Korea and so on, “Political dissent” including “exposing human rights abuses by the government” is actually illegal.
So I guess in a way, you could say ""See, all uses are illegal"" - in the sense that there are some countries on this planet where ""exposing human rights abuses"" is illegal. - As an example, it is illegal to discuss the Tiananmen Square massacre in China(via web chat program) How China has censored words relating to the Tiananmen Square anniversary
But if exposing the illegal behaviour of a powerful business or government is illegal, then we are starting to fall down the rabbit hole of illegalception where we start to ask stupid questions like “If it was illegal to talk about illegal actions, wouldn’t it be illegal for the Police to arrest a person that did something illegal, given that the police would then have to be communicating about illegal activity?”

Ok, here is what’s real and not about the dark web.

killer for hire? Scam
hacker for hire, I’ll hack the NSA for YOU, LOLZ. Scam
fake passports, guns, etc. Scams
escorts (mostly scams)
I SELL REAL SEX SLAVES, DELIVERY ANYWHERE. How people can take that seriously is beyond comprehension. Obvious scam.
so, what is real? Mostly legal and fairly mundane stuff.
plenty of anonymous tools (mail in particular)
plenty of information/discussion sites about non mainstream subjects, including about drugs, weapons, explosives, lockpicking, various weird conspiracy stuff (a lot!)
tools related to bitcoins
some porn, not really different from what you’ll find on the web
various hosting sites (for images, files, text)
blogs
forums (similar to 4Chan)
books
plenty of drugs selling sites (some of those are real)
Now, do you really think that there is that much to find there? The FBI and others are already taking care of the most blatantly illegal stuff.
Also, you may have read that the dark web was thousands of times the size of the web. Well, no it isn’t! The best estimates put the number of sites at a few dozen of thousands! At most.

35,"There are 4 million people in Los Angeles. I have heard there are lots of criminals there. Why does the government allow them to exist?
As I write this, there are four good answers that will tell you all you need to know about the dark web. Since the Internet is an open system where anyone can read the “payload” (the information content) of every packet that is sent, the overwhelming majority of information on the Internet today is protected with encryption.
Encryption is a mathematical technique. It is used in a variety of tools to scramble information so that it will make no sense to anyone except the sender and the receiver. These tools include the familiar HTTPS←Secure WWW browsing protocol, the VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) that you use to connect from a remote location to your company’s private internal network (or that you can use through a commercial VPN provider to connect with anything), and a special flavor of virtual network like TOR (The Onion Router protocol) that assures someone in the middle of a traffic conversation is unable to track down the origen or the destination of the packets. (TOR conversations are part of the “dark web” in the question.)
Just like the City of Los Angeles, the Internet is a big place. It has dark alleys where bad guys can hang out. The dark web is one one those dark alleys. Maybe half of the xxx.ONION sites on the TOR network are bad places. However, most of the people who use the TOR system are simply people who use it to give themselves anonymity. This includes the United States federal government that created the TOR protocol, released it for public use, and still invests in its development.
In the early days of the Internet, the only way to access it was to get a leased line feed from a university or a company that was itself connected. Then America OnLine began to offer a dial-up connection to “The Internet” — but it wasn’t. AOL was a curated and sanitized version of the Internet. Finally, in about 1992, Delphi (my first Internet Service Provider) and other ISPs began to offer dial-up connections to the complete Internet.
What you can see today with a Google search can be compared to the view of “the Internet” from AOL in the early years. It includes the most popular and useful public sites. Google is NOT the Internet! There is lots more out there.
Anyone can hook a server up to the Internet and anyone else can find it if they know that server’s numeric TCP/IP Internet Protocol address. There is no rule that says it must be reachable through a NAME that gets listed in the Domain Name Server (DNS) system. The Internet is just an interconnected set of highways across which people can send data packets. It is neither good nor bad.
Efforts to “police” the Internet to completely eliminate bad actors end up becoming totalitarian regimes. The Internet set the world free. Realizing this, totalitarian governments today try to control and censor its content within their boarders. Sadly, there are also unsophisticated users in the US who discover something or hear about something on the Internet that they do not like, and then clamor for the government to put a stop to it. Many of their “solutions” would destroy the value of the Internet in the free world. Our own government is already frighteningly intrusive in our communications. We need more protections, not less. TOR and its dark web is just one of those tools.

36,"I think that this maybe happened once, more likely not. These all stories are creepy-pastas just written to scare people, because people love to be scared. Deep/dark web is internet just like clearnet, with better anonymity.
Definitely, there are a lot of weird people, but on the clearnet, there is even more weird people, they just don’t talk about it.
Another thing is “web-cam hack”. Definitely, it is possible but only in case you download some weird executable file and you run it. Stories about just accesing it and immidiately getting completely hacked PC are just trash, again - to scare people.
Also a lot of people say that it’s not anonymous/safe at all (wether to FBI or to people who wanna kill you etc…). Do you think, that it would be so widely used if it was not anonymous? Do you think, that it would be hated so much by FBI, if it was not anonymous? I’m not trying to say that you are 100% safe there but I think that the real number in precentage is about 98%. I believe that the best IT guys can find you but even for them it is extremly hard.
You can actually find a lot of great services there. I was really scared to go there as well but then I found out that it’s not at all like in these stupid creepy-pastas.

38,"Deep web is similar to the normal web, except it is slow and boring. There really isn't much going on down there unless you are specifically looking for something illegal and don't want to get caught up in an investigation.
The only way to describe it is like going to the worst part of town. If you take a trip downtown to the bad neighborhood, you wouldn't introduce yourself to the locals, show them your ID and credit card, tell them where you live or give them your phone number. Same with the dark web. I, like many, were curious as to what's going on in that neighborhood. But I went in with sunglasses on, hood up, cap on, left my phone and wallet at home, and told everyone who asked that my name is Bob, or Steve, or Dan etc.
But just like taking a trip to the bad neighborhood, you expect to see lots of crime, crazy things going down on every street corner, flashing lights from the police. In reality it's just an area where people are just getting on with their everyday lives. You can find the criminal activity in the neighborhood if you look hard enough, but you risk getting caught up in it inadvertently. You go back home to your nice safe neighborhood and wonder why you bothered wasting a trip over to the other place when it's no different to yours.

Does it look similar to this?
Even if it’s not that exact one, there are several “red room” sites run by the same person or people (or at least they appear to be). My best guess is that either it’s a scam, as I said above, or it’s a honeypot, i.e. something designed to catch hackers or other would-be criminals in the act.
Therefore, I don’t think that reporting a site like that would do much good. On the other hand, if you find a site that has child pornography on it, that is something you can report! (Yes, unfortunately that exists, and no, I don’t seek it out; anyone else who’s used Tor probably knows this.) Go to CyberTipline - NCMEC and give them the link, and describe it as much as you can. If you don’t want to get yourself in trouble, just don’t leave any personal information - although I think they appreciate people for reporting them.
